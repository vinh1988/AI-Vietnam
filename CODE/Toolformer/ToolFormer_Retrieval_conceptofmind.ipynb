I\\'ve done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won\\'t be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that\\'s mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\\nI\\'ve actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\\nThanks for pointing this out.

So, what was I to do except fulfilling his demand? Baking (not only pies), is a cooking method where tools DO actually make the man, which means that it is very hard or nearly impossible to do it successfully without proper bakeware.\\nWith years of experience under my belt, I’ve learned about and discovered what truly matters when looking for bakeware to buy, and I am going to teach you later in the article.\\nAlso, I have reviewed what I believe to be the best five non-stick bakeware sets out there, so make sure to check them out if you are in search of one.\\nThe first and most obvious reason is – because food doesn’t stick to it! I do not want to sound overly simplistic, but any chef (or mom, as a matter of fact) knows that pans that stick will absolutely mess up the outcome.\\nPeople normally solve this problem by oiling up, but I don’t like it since it makes the food greasy. Using non-stick bakeware is a healthier, more convenient, and more practical way of baking.\\nThe next thing that you might not have known is that non-stick bakeware is so much easier to clean than more conventional types. It is a no-brainer really – if nothing sticks to the surface then there won’t be anything to scrub, scrape or wash off.\\nThis trait right here will save you tons of time as well as frustration, and it might motivate you to bake more often because of the hassle-free cleaning process. Just make sure to maintain the bakeware.\\n\\u200bLastly, even heat distribution is another thing that you should look for, and this type of bakeware enables it.\\nHere\\'s the deal: heat distribution most likely won\\'t affect the quality of the result, but it will make the bakeware heat up more quickly which will ultimately decrease the cooking time.\\nInvesting a little bit of time into research can save you a lot of money and trouble in the long run, and that is why you need to read this section carefully.\\nBakeware sets differ regarding materials, abilities, cost, and maintenance, so learning about some general features of these products will help you decide which type will fulfill your demands.\\nBakeware can be made from different kinds of materials including iron, glass, copper, steel, etc.\\nToday I will mention only the types that are related to products I reviewed in this article.\\nIt is important to know that each material yields different cooking properties so study these paragraphs to find out which one is right for you.\\nCarbon steel – this material is light, durable, and reacts to temperature changes very quickly, meaning that it can heat up fast. Even though is lightweight, it is a bit heavier than copper and doesn\\'t retain heat as well as iron. It\\'s a good choice for baking meats, veggies, bread, and cakes.\\nCopper – it is an excellent heat conductor and doesn’t need pre-heating since it gets hot very quickly. Very light, but also quite expensive compared to other bakeware materials. Also, it isn’t the best choice for recipes that require baking under very high heat.\\nSilicon – good for foods where sticking is an issue, such as breads, cookies, and cakes. It is light, affordable and dishes will slide out of it easily. The one downside is that it can be frustrating to wash because it is so elastic, but luckily, most of the silicon bakeware is dishwasher safe.\\nSince you’ll be buying an entire set of products, it would be a good idea to find one that is suitable for all kinds of baking jobs. Make sure that all the basic items such as pie pan, muffin pan, loaf pan, cookie sheet, cake pan, or whatever you need, is included in the package.\\nThis is a feature that most folks overlook, and it makes a world of difference when it comes to handling the pan. It\\'s easy to move the dish around when it\\'s cold but taking it out of a scorching hot oven is a different story (trust me, I know). You’ll try to be cautious not to burn your fingers so it is easy not to pay attention to the contents of the pan which can lead to spillage and a messy kitchen.\\nLook for bakeware that has nice, ergonomic handles or handling areas. Some models have silicon added to these parts for extra protection and ease of use.\\nNot all types of bakeware can withstand the same temperatures; as a matter of fact, this trait greatly differs from product to product. Certain pans are oven safe to up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, while others cannot take more than 350.\\nThis is a significant difference so pay close attention to this detail when buying a set.\\nNow, let’s get into the meaty part of this article – the reviews.\\nAfter trying out many sets, I’ve reached some conclusions and decided to put together a list of my favorite ones.\\nKeep in mind that these are my personal choices, but they are also top rated products.\\nRachel Ray is a world-renowned chef and TV personality, and her famous Cucina line of products never fails to deliver. Here, we are dealing with an excellent, 10-piece set that I personally think very highly of.\\nThe material that this bakeware is made of is carbon steel, and the non-stick, latte-colored coating looks very pretty and does the job well.\\nA thing that I didn’t like about the construction of this set is that everything is so bulky. It is not a huge issue, but folks who lack storage space will not be thrilled with these products.\\nAs far as items are concerned, the set includes two loaf pans, two cake pans, two cookie sheets, two pie plates, a muffin tin, and a plastic cake pan topper.\\nIn my opinion, this is more than enough, but I’m sure some folks are going to be disappointed because there’s no pizza pan included.\\nThe handles have silicon grips attached to them, and this is a big bonus when it comes to practicality and handling. Also, the rolled edges allow you to grab the pan more easily and move it around securely.\\nThe pan can withstand heat of up to 450 F, and I think that this should be sufficient for most baking jobs. Make sure not to go over this temperature because you could burn the pans.\\nCopper has gained a lot of popularity in the cooking world over the last few years, and honestly, I can only say good things about it. Copper Chef is known for a plethora of cookware, and now we are taking a look at their baking set.\\nAs I\\'ve mentioned before, copper is a fantastic heat conductor, and the heat distribution in this material is as even as it gets.\\nPersonally, I find the latter feature very important because I like to have consistency in my cooking.\\nThis is a 12-piece set that consists of a 12-cup muffin pan, a cookie sheet, a loaf pan, a square pan, and eight pieces of silicon ramekin cups with lids.\\nOk, so I think it is a bit unfair for a company to advertise a set of twelve copper products while only four of them are actually made of this material. While the ramekin cups are lovely, they seem to be a cheap filler in this set.\\nAs far as handling is concerned, most of the products in this pack do not have handles, so you have to rely on the rolled edges for gripping. This is a big disadvantage in my opinion, and greatly handicaps the ease of use.\\nThese black, sturdy-looking baking dishes remind me of old-school bakeware sets that people used to bake with a few decades ago. However, this is a modern and versatile set that should fulfill most of your demands.\\nThe ChefLand set is made of carbon steel; it looks pretty plain but has a non-stick coating that\\'s quite effective. One thing that this material is good at is even heat distribution, so you won’t need to worry about hotspots.\\nThe products are dishwasher safe, however, after several months of kind of cleaning, some items started to form rust on the outer edges, which is a big minus. I would recommend washing them by hand.\\nWhen it comes to the items, ChefLand’s set includes a roasting pan, a round pizza pan, a large and medium cookie sheet, two round cake pans, a square cake pan, a loaf pan, an oven crisper pan, and a 12-cup muffin pan. As far as I’m concerned this set has everything covered!\\nMost of the dishes have handles on them, and even those which don\\'t, have a nice grip area that allows for good handling.\\nUnfortunately, there is no silicon padding or protective surface so you will need to use gloves or cloth.\\nThis bakeware set comes to us from Sunbeam; it is a bit smaller set in terms of the number of items in it, but a worthy addition to today\\'s list. Oh, I forgot to mention it’s cheap as chips!\\nThe material these pans are made of is carbon steel, and its non-stick features are achieved with a xylan coating interior and exterior. The black color gives it a pretty plain, non-exciting look, but I personally do not mind this.\\nThe Sunbeam set has only 5-pieces, which is significantly less than other sets we reviewed today. The dishes included are a loaf pan, a cookie sheet, a 6-cup muffin pan, and two round cake pans.\\nOne disadvantage of this set is that it cannot handle temperatures higher than 400 F, which is quite limiting because some recipes require more heat.\\nAll of the pans have handles or enough room to grab them properly and handle safely.\\nNow as I was reading some online commentary, many people complained that pans arrived dented or bent when they ordered them, so this might be an issue.\\nI haven’t experienced this myself, so I just want to put it out as a warning.\\nThis set differs from others I reviewed today because it is the only one that’s not made of metal.\\nBoxiki Kitchen brings us this 3-piece silicone set that bread and cake lovers might find interesting.\\nAs I’ve said, these products are made of silicone which has its pros and cons.\\nThe good thing is that food will just slide out of it, but it might be irritating when trying to wash it by hand because it’s so bendy. A lot of people raise concerns about chemicals in this material, so you’ll be glad to know that this set is FDA approved and non-toxic.\\nThe set comes with three items – a round cake pan, a square brownie pan, and a banana bread/meatloaf pan.\\nAll of the dishes are equipped with metal handles which allows for a nice and solid grip, so you won’t have to worry about the pans slipping out of your hands.\\nSilicone is generally oven safe up to 500 degrees F, which is fantastic and much better than some metal products, so you won’t need to worry about burning your bakeware.\\nHowever, the metal handles don\\'t seem to take high temperatures very well, and I\\'ve heard some reports of them flaking and bubbling at 400 F.\\nI hope that the article was helpful and that it got you acquainted with the basics of bakeware.\\nNow, the time has come for me to declare my top pick of the day, and the product that got most of my sympathies is Rachel Ray’s 10-piece Cucina Set.\\nIts beautiful design is what attracted me to this bakeware set, but the excellent performance made an even stronger impression.\\nNon-stick surface does its job flawlessly, and the carbon steel construction is sturdy and strong.\\nThis is a very good list, i have tested myself the Rachel Ray’s 10-Piece Cucina Bakeware Set and i’m satisfied with it, it fulfill most of my daily cooking.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-20T02:37:15Z', 'url': 'https://kitchenbyte.com/best-bakeware-sets/'}\n","{'text': 'UNStudio has joined forces with HPP Architects to create a consortium (UNS + HPP) to carry out the next phases of their winning project at the architectural design competition for FOUR Frankfurt. Take a look at the complete story after the jump.\\nFrom the architects: The centrally located 16,000 square meter site was purchased by Groß & Partner real estate development company – who will be carrying out the development of the project – back in 2015. Situated in the very core of the city, the site has been completely inaccessible for the last 45 years. Now four new high-rise towers will change Frankfurt’s skyline from the air, while cultivating its liveliness on the ground. The development of these towers, reaching heights of 228 meters, will open up new streets to create a multi-use, vibrant inner-city quarter, bringing together a healthy mix of work, living, relaxation and recreation.\\nThe choice of programmes allows for a smooth transition from Frankfurt’s shopping district to the east of Roßmarkt, to the high-rise office towers clustered around Park Taunusanlage. With a development concept that is unique to Europe, the FOUR Frankfurt project brings together facilities that will establish a lively new neighbourhood for Frankfurt, its visitors, and its (future) residents.\\nThe new high-rise complex will be integrated into the expanding city structure by incorporating the heritage-listed facades of the Junghofstraße into the design and by making a multi-storey base building the connecting element of the entire site.\\nAccording to the assessment by the competition jury, the unique quality of the quarter can be found in its public development and amenity value. The new development will therefore create connected spaces, accessible rooftops, pathways and passages. The existing block on the Junghofstraße will be opened up to strengthen the surrounding pathways and ensure a high level of accessibility. This will create a multi-use, diverse quarter comprising 50% office spaces, 30% living accommodation (including subsidized housing), in addition to retail spaces, restaurants and hotels.\\nFour Frankfurt is expected to be completed in 2023.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-18T12:20:23Z', 'url': 'https://www.archiscene.net/tower/four-frankfurt-unstudio/'}\n","{'text': 'Quartz is one of the most common and varied minerals on earth, and its abundant colors produce many gemstone types. Amethyst and Citrine are the most popular and valuable gem varieties of Quartz, but other forms also make important gemstones. Chalcedony describes any form of Quartz that is microcrystalline, in compact form without any visible crystals. Chalcedony also has several varieties used as gemstones, most notably Agate, Carnelian, Tiger\\'s Eye, and Chrysoprase.\\nPure Quartz, which is also known as Rock Crystal, is colorless. Various impurities are responsible for the extensive range of colors. The main crystalline Quartz varieties used as gemstones are described below.\\nAmethyst, the purple variety, is the most popular and valuable Quartz gemstone. Amethyst ranges from light to dark purple. See the Amethyst gemstone page for more details.\\nCitrine is the yellow, orange, or reddish-brown variety of Quartz. It is usually colored by heat treatment of Amethyst or Smoky Quartz. Light yellow or lemon yellow Citrine is often called Lemon Quartz in the gem trade. See the Citrine gemstone page for more details.\\nSmoky Quartz is the brown \"smoky\" variety of Quartz. It ranges in color from light brown to black. Despite its dark color, it is rarely opaque. See the Smoky Quartz gemstone page for more details.\\nThe rosy pink variety of Quartz is known as Rose Quartz, and its color is usually soft, ranging from very light pink to medium pink in intensity.

See the Rose Quartz gemstone page for more details.\\nThe colorless, transparent variety of Quartz, free of any impurities, is known as \"Rock Crystal\". Flawless and very large cuts may be cut from Rock Crystal.\\nMilky Quartz is the white, translucent to opaque variety of Quartz. Though very common in nature, it is not used as a gemstone.\\nColorless Quartz with golden yellow Rutile inclusions, as hairlike growths within the gemstone, are known as Rutilated Quartz. See the Rutilated Quartz gemstone page for more details.\\nAmetrine is an interesting, color-zoned combination of purple Amethyst and brownish-yellow Citrine. See the Ametrine gemstone page for more details.\\nPrasiolite, or Green Quartz, describes a light green Quartz artificially colored by heat treatment of certain types of Amethyst. May also be called \"Green Amethyst\" by some jewelers.\\nThe blue variety of Quartz, which is uncommon in nature, is seldom used as a gemstone. Most \"Blue Quartz\" is clear Rock Crystal irradiated with gold to from a deep sky blue color. Blue Quartz may also refer to a dull grayish-blue Quartz in massive form with Crocidolite inclusions.\\nColorless Quartz with Tourmaline inclusions, often as thin long black crystals, is known as \"Tourmalinated Quartz\".\\nCat\\'s Eye Quartz is Quartz with dense, tiny Rutile inclusions that cause a cat\\'s eye effect. It is not common, and the chatoyant effect is usually weak. Cat\\'s Eye Quartz is usually grayish in color and translucent.\\nAll forms of Quartz are used as gemstones, and they are all affordable. They are cut into various gemstone cuts and cabochons, and used in all forms of jewelry. Lesser quality stones are often tumbled for use in bracelets, necklaces, and as costume jewelery. Large spheres and carvings are also cut from all the Quartz forms. Due to its abundance and lack of luster, Rock Crystal is not commonly cut into gemstones, although some very large spheres and sculptures are carved from it. Small crystals of Rock Crystal are sometime worn as pendants, sometimes being polished and smoothed, and sometimes in their entirely natural crystal form.\\nVarieties specific to Amethyst, Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Rutilated Quartz, and Chalcedony are listed separately.\\nAmethyst\\t- Purple variety of Quartz, and its most popular and valuable gemstone variety. (See the Amethyst gemstone page for more details.) Tumbled Amethyst with white Milky Quartz is sometimes known as Amethyst Quartz.\\nAventurine\\t- Opaque, compact Quartz / Chalcedony containing small Mica, Hematite, or Goethite scales which cause a glistening effect. Aventurine is most often green but may also be other colors such as gray, orange, and brown.\\nBlue Quartz - Rare natural blue variety of Quartz. It is caused by inclusions of blue minerals, especially Dumortierite. Most \"Blue Quartz\" is what is popularly known as \"Aqua Aura\", essentially clear Rock Crystal synthetically irradiated with gold to form a deep sky blue color. Blue Quartz may also refer to a dull grayish-blue Quartz in massive form with Crocidolite inclusions.\\nCat\\'s Eye Quartz - Quartz with dense, tiny Rutile inclusions that cause a cat\\'s eye effect. Cat\\'s Eye Quartz is not common, and the chatoyant effect is usually weak. Cat\\'s Eye Quartz is usually grayish in color and translucent.\\nLemon Quartz - Lemon Quartz is a light to dark yellow Citrine, distinguished from most Citrine by lacking orange, brown, or reddish tints. More often though it is clear Quartz that is irradiated to produce an intensely colored yellow gemstone. Lemon Quartz has recently experienced a popularity increase in the gemstone market.\\nMilky Quartz - White, translucent to opaque variety of Quartz. It is not commonly used as a gemstone.\\nPrase - Light to emerald green, transparent to translucent Quartz / Chalcedony, with coloring caused from inclusions of green minerals, such as Actinolite, Hedenbergite, Chlorite, or Malachite.\\nPrasiolite - Light green gem form Quartz artificially colored by heat treatment of certain types of Amethyst. May also be called Green Amethyst by some jewelers.\\nRock Crystal - The colorless, transparent variety of Quartz, free of impurities is called \"Rock Crystal\".\\nTourmalinated Quartz - Quartz with splintery Tourmaline inclusions.\\nAmethyst may be heat treated to deepen the purple color. Most gem Citrine is produced by heat treating Amethyst, and the green Quartz known as Prasiolite or \"Green Amethyst\" is also produced by heating Amethyst from specific localities.\\nCertain colorful Quartz types not found in nature are produced through irradiation. Some forms of Quartz with a multicolored rainbow effect are synthetically treated to produce their color effect using film deposition. The process involves bonding an extremely thin metallic film layer over the top of the gemstone, so that the interesting color effects are reflected from the crown. Some vividly colorful forms of Quartz are synthetic grown using the hydrothermal method.\\nQuartz is extremely common and is found in numerous localities throughout the world. The important sources are far too numerous to mention, though in general the most prolific countries that produce Quartz gemstones are Brazil, Madagascar, India, and the U.S. (Arkansas). Specific sources for the popular Quartz varieties are described on their dedicated pages.\\nSee the individual variety pages for specific variety similarities.\\nRock crystal is similar to glass, but the softness of glass usually lends it to scratches and soft etches which are lacking on Rock Crystal. Rock Crystal is rarely cut into small facets, so it usually is not a concern of confusion to other colorless gems such as Diamond, White Topaz, and White Sapphire. These white gemstones will also have a greater dispersion and exhibit more fire.\\nAdditional images for the varieties Amethyst, Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Rose Quartz, Rutilated Quartz, and Chalcedony are listed separately.\\nHave a question about Quartz?

The problem may not be obvious, and it may not even be a problem that people are aware of, but the problem exists. Using Instagram as a case study, I think there are four keys a platforms success.\\nMost people aren't professional photographers. They don't have access to the tools professional photographers use nor the time or money to buy the tools and learn them. But they do want professional looking photos. Instagram built a platform that had intrinsic value on it's own by providing people the ability to easily create professional looking photographs.\\nOne of the keys that made Instagram successful was that they took something people were already doing and made it easier and better. They removed the need to download photos from a mobile device and then upload them from a desktop or laptop. They simplified the process and allowed users to share exiting photos right from their phones or take a new photo to share.\\nThey also simplified an otherwise complex photo editing process by providing a set of templates that people could apply without having to understand image editing. This enabled a regular person to have professional looking photos without any work.\\nOne thing that Instagram did very well is that it built it's software to work with exiting services like Facebook and Twitter. Services that already had a huge community of users. They didn't try to re-create Twitter or Facebook. Instead, they allowed Twitter and Facebook to get better by making their service interoperable.\\nInstagram didn't force people to ONLY use their service. Instead, it allowed people to continue to use their existing social media services and augment a specific workflow to be better if they wanted to. Users don't want to be asked to chose between this OR that. They want to be able to use this AND that.

Human periodontal ligament (hPDL) fibroblasts play a major mediating role in orthodontic tooth movement and periodontitis. Despite corresponding in-vitro gene expression studies being a focus of interest for many years, no information is available for hPDL fibroblasts on suitable reference genes, which are generally used in RT-qPCR experiments to normalize variability between samples. The aim of this study was to identify and validate suitable reference genes for normalization in untreated hPDL fibroblasts as well as experiments on orthodontic tooth movement or periodontitis (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). We investigated the suitability of 13 candidate reference genes using four different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, comparative Delta C-q and BestKeeper) and ranked them according to their expression stability. Overall PPIB (peptidylprolyl isomerase A), TBP (TATA-box-binding protein) and RPL22 (ribosomal protein 22) were found to be most stably expressed with two genes in conjunction sufficient for reliable normalization. This study provides an accurate tool for quantitative gene expression analysis in hPDL fibroblasts according to the MIQE guidelines and shows that reference gene reliability is treatment-specific.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-26T14:24:09Z', 'url': 'https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/36212/'}\n","{'text': 'Irish crime thriller at its best, Stuart Neville is a fantastic writer.

What is it? What does it mean? How do you get it and how do you KNOW you got it?\\nHonestly, I don’t know the answers to these questions. I have no way of describing something I don’t understand BUT believe deeply in my soul that it exists. How do you get these graces? Sanctifying grace is IN your soul. It’s the free and underserved gift from God. Actual grace would come from our knowledge and belief of all things right and wrong – following the Ten Commandments, making sure we follow a path that is pure and justified. Justified means to be sinless, and to be sinless means you are in favor with God. When you are baptized you are sinless and therefore have favor with God. When you go to reconciliation, you are once again sinless and in favor with God. You are in a state of grace. Once sanctifying grace is in your soul, you can increase it by every good action you do – receiving Communion, saying prayers, performing corporal works of Mercy. The most important thing to think about is NOT what you are going to do or how you are going to do it but to recognize God’s love. The reason you can do any good work is because God LOVES YOU FIRST in Grace. You must continually seek God’s grace, continually respond to the actual graces God is working within you, inclining you to turn to Him and do good.\\nHave I answered the question as to what Grace is? I’ve read through all the study guides provided to me and compiled all the information, but I don’t believe that I’ve properly explained what Grace is.\\nTo me Grace is a feeling. Sometimes it’s butterflies in the stomach, and it takes my breath away. I feel this way every time I think of my husband. We met and married 38 years ago. I see God’s grace in our meeting, getting married, and living our life together as husband and wife. Sometimes it’s a jolt, like an electric shock and then an overwhelming wave of love, like the enormous amount of love I felt when I held my first baby in my arms for the first time. This happened again with my 2nd and 3rd child, and then God blessed us with twins to make 4 and 5. Then sometimes it feels like a raging fight going on inside me, making hard decisions that breaks my heart in two. I have no power to stop things from happening and my only recourse is just to constantly pray. Mostly it’s a feeling of ultimate peace and an over-whelming calmness that comes over me at different times during the day when God allows me glimpses of HIS love for me: when my dog and cat are doing something cute together; when I see the birds eating the seed I put out for them; when a certain little girl comes over to the house and calls me “Grandma”. I just breathe a sigh of thanksgiving and relax in the comfort of His hand.\\nWhere does Grace come from?', 'timestamp': '2019-04-18T12:25:43Z', 'url': 'https://stmarysdsm.org/ministry/gof/how-to-recognize-grace/'}\n","{'text': 'Sellers who are non-residents (eg. foreigners living abroad and Japanese citizens living abroad).\\nBuyers, both local and overseas residents, who are buying real estate in Japan from a non-resident.\\nIf the seller of Japanese real estate is a non-resident, depending on the situation, the buyer must withhold 10.21% of the sale price and pay it to the tax office, with the remaining 89.79% paid to the seller.

Arnold, H Division; Inspector Abberline, of the Criminal Investigation Department, and Inspector Nairn represented the police. The deputy coroner, Mr. Hodgkinson, was present during the proceedings.\\nThe Coroner (to the juror, severely): Do you think that we do not know what we are doing here, and that we do not know our own district? The jury are summoned in the ordinary way, and they have no business to object. If they persist in their objection I shall know how to deal with them. Does any juror persist in objecting ?\\nThe Juror: We are summoned for the Shoreditch district. This affair happened in Spitalfields. The Coroner: It happened within my district.\\nThe jury having made no further objection, they were duly sworn, and were conducted by Inspector Abberline to view the body, which, decently coffined, was at the mortuary adjoining Shoreditch Church, and subsequently the jury inspected the room, in Miller\\'s-court, Dorset- street, where the murder was committed. The apartment, a plan of which was given in yesterday\\'s Daily Telegraph, is poorly furnished, and uncarpeted. The position of the two tables was not altered. One of them was placed near the bed, behind the door, and the other next to the largest of the two windows which look upon the yard in which the dustbin and water-tap are situated.\\nJoseph Barnett deposed : I was a fish-porter, and I work as a labourer and fruit- porter. Until Saturday last I lived at 24, New-street, Bishopsgate, and have since stayed at my sister\\'s, 21, Portpool-lane, Gray\\'s Inn-road. I have lived with the deceased one year and eight months. Her name was Marie Jeanette Kelly with the French spelling as described to me. Kelly was her maiden name. I have seen the body, and I identify it by the ear and eyes, which are all that I can recognise; but I am positive it is the same woman I knew. I lived with her in No. 13 room, at Miller\\'s-court for eight months. I separated from her on Oct. 30.\\n[Coroner] Why did you leave her ? - Because she had a woman of bad character there, whom she took in out of compassion, and I objected to it. That was the only reason. I left her on the Tuesday between five and six p.m. I last saw her alive between half-past seven and a quarter to eight on Thursday night last, when I called upon her. I stayed there for a quarter of an hour.\\n[Coroner] Were you on good terms ? - Yes, on friendly terms; but when we parted I told her I had no work, and had nothing to give her, for which I was very sorry.\\n[Coroner] Did you drink together ? - No, sir. She was quite sober.\\n[Coroner] Was she, generally speaking, of sober habits ? - When she was with me I found her of sober habits, but she has been drunk several times in my presence.\\n[Coroner] Was there any one else there on the Thursday evening ? - Yes, a woman who lives in the court. She left first, and I followed shortly afterwards.\\n[Coroner] Have you had conversation with deceased about her parents ? - Yes, frequently. She said she was born in Limerick, and went when very young to Wales. She did not say how long she lived there, but that she came to London about four years ago. Her father\\'s name was John Kelly, a \"gaffer\" or foreman in an iron works in Carnarvonshire, or Carmarthen. She said she had one sister, who was respectable, who travelled from market place to market place. This sister was very fond of her. There were six brothers living in London, and one was in the army. One of them was named Henry. I never saw the brothers to my knowledge. She said she was married when very young in Wales to a collier. I think the name was Davis or Davies. She said she had lived with him until he was killed in an explosion, but I cannot say how many years since that was. Her age was, I believe, 16 when she married. After her husband\\'s death deceased went to Cardiff to a cousin.\\n[Coroner] Did she live there long ? - Yes, she was in an infirmary there for eight or nine months. She was following a bad life with her cousin, who, as I reckon, and as I often told her, was the cause of her downfall.\\n[Coroner] After she left Cardiff did she come direct to London ? - Yes. She was in a gay house in the West-end, but in what part she did not say. A gentleman came there to her and asked her if she would like to go to France.\\n[Coroner] Did she go to France ? - Yes; but she did not remain long. She said she did not like the part, but whether it was the part or purpose I cannot say. She was not there more than a fortnight, and she returned to England, and went to Ratcliffe-highway. She must have lived there for some time. Afterwards she lived with a man opposite the Commercial Gas Works, Stepney. The man\\'s name was Morganstone.\\n[Coroner] Have you seen that man ? - Never. I don\\'t know how long she lived with him.\\n[Coroner] Was Morganstone the last man she lived with ? - I cannot answer that question, but she described a man named Joseph Fleming, who came to Pennington-street, a bad house, where she stayed. I don\\'t know when this was. She was very fond of him. He was a mason\\'s plasterer, and lodged in the Bethnal-green-road.\\n[Coroner] Was that all you knew of her history when you lived with her? - Yes. After she lived with Morganstone or Fleming - I don\\'t know which one was the last - she lived with me.\\n[Coroner] Where did you pick up with her first ? - In Commercial-street. We then had a drink together, and I made arrangements to see her on the following day - a Saturday. On that day we both of us agreed that we should remain together. I took lodgings in George-street, Commercial-street, where I was known. I lived with her, until I left her, on very friendly terms.\\n[Coroner] Did she express fear of any particular individual ? - No, sir. Our own quarrels were very soon over.\\nThomas Bowyer stated: I live at 37, Dorset-street, and am employed by Mr. McCarthy. I serve in his chandler\\'s shop, 27, Dorset-street. At a quarter to eleven a.m., on Friday morning, I was ordered by McCarthy to go to Mary Jane\\'s room, No. 13. I did not know the deceased by the name of Kelly. I went for rent, which was in arrears. Knocking at the door, I got no answer, and I knocked again and again. Receiving no reply, I passed round the corner by the gutter spout where there is a broken window - it is the smallest window.\\nCharles Ledger, an inspector of police, G Division, produced a plan of the premises. Bowyer pointed out the window, which was the one nearest the entrance.\\nHe [Bowyer] continued: There was a curtain. I put my hand through the broken pane and lifted the curtain. I saw two pieces of flesh lying on the table.\\n[Coroner] Where was this table ? - In front of the bed, close to it. The second time I looked I saw a body on this bed, and blood on the floor. I at once went very quietly to Mr. McCarthy. We then stood in the shop, and I told him what I had seen. We both went to the police-station, but first of all we went to the window, and McCarthy looked in to satisfy himself. We told the inspector at the police-station of what we had seen. Nobody else knew of the matter. The inspector returned with us.\\n[Coroner] Did you see the deceased constantly ? - I have often seen her. I knew the last witness, Barnett. I have seen the deceased drunk once.\\nJohn McCarthy, grocer and lodging-house keeper, testified: I live at 27, Dorset- street. On Friday morning, about a quarter to eleven, I sent my man Bowyer to Room 13 to call for rent. He came back in five minutes, saying, \"Guv\\'nor, I knocked at the door, and could not make any one answer; I looked through the window and saw a lot of blood.\" I accompanied him, and looked through the window myself, saw the blood and the woman. For a moment I could not say anything, and I then said: \"You had better fetch the police.\" I knew the deceased as Mary Jane Kelly, and had no doubt at all about her identity. I followed Bowyer to Commercial-street Police-station, where I saw Inspector Beck. I inquired at first for Inspector Reid. Inspector Beck returned with me at once.\\n[Coroner] How long had the deceased lived in the room ? - Ten months. She lived with Barnett. I did not know whether they were married or not; they lived comfortably together, but they had a row when the window was broken. The bedstead, bed-clothes, table, and every article of furniture belonged to me.\\n[Coroner] What rent was paid for this room ? - It was supposed to be 4s 6d a week. Deceased was in arrears 29s. I was to be paid the rent weekly. Arrears are got as best you can. I frequently saw the deceased the worse for drink. When sober she was an exceptionally quiet woman, but when in drink she had more to say. She was able to walk about, and was not helpless.\\n[Coroner] Where was this ? - In Dorset-street. She went up the court, a few steps in front of me.\\n[Coroner] Was anybody with her ? - A short, stout man, shabbily dressed. He had on a longish coat, very shabby, and carried a pot of ale in his hand.\\n[Coroner] What was the colour of the coat ? - A dark coat.\\n[Coroner] What hat had he ? - A round hard billycock.\\n[Coroner] Long or short hair ? - I did not notice. He had a blotchy face, and full carrotty moustache.\\n[Coroner] The chin was shaven ? - Yes. A lamp faced the door.\\n[Coroner] Did you see them go into her room ? - Yes; I said \"Good night, Mary,\" and she turned round and banged the door.\\n[Coroner] Had he anything in his hands but the can ? - No.\\n[Coroner] Did she say anything ? - She said \"Good night, I am going to have a song.\" As I went in she sang \"A violet I plucked from my mother\\'s grave when a boy.\" I remained a quarter of an hour in my room and went out. Deceased was still singing at one o\\'clock when I returned. I remained in the room for a minute to warm my hands as it was raining, and went out again. She was singing still, and I returned to my room at three o\\'clock. The light was then out and there was no noise.\\n[Coroner] Did you go to sleep ? - No; I was upset. I did not undress at all. I did not sleep at all. I must have heard what went on in the court. I heard no noise or cry of \"Murder,\" but men went out to work in the market.\\n[Coroner] How many men live in the court who work in Spitalfields Market ? - One. At a quarter- past six I heard a man go down the court. That was too late for the market.\\n[Coroner] From what house did he go ? - I don\\'t know.\\n[Coroner] Did you hear the door bang after him ? - No.\\n[Coroner] Then he must have walked up the court and back again? - Yes.\\n[Coroner] It might have been a policeman ? - It might have been.\\n[Coroner] What would you take the stout man\\'s age to be ? - Six-and-thirty.\\n[Coroner] Did you notice the colour of his trousers ? - All his clothes were dark.\\n[Coroner] Did his boots sound as if the heels were heavy ? - There was no sound as he went up the court.\\n[Coroner] Then you think that his boots were down at heels ? - He made no noise.\\n[Coroner] What clothes had Mary Jane on ? - She had no hat; a red pelerine and a shabby skirt.\\n[Coroner] You say she was drunk ? - I did not notice she was drunk until she said good night. The man closed the door. By the Jury: There was a light in the window, but I saw nothing, as the blinds were down. I should know the man again, if I saw him.\\n[Coroner] Do you often hear cries of \"Murder?\" - It is nothing unusual in the street. I did not take particular notice.\\n[Coroner] Did you hear it a second time? - No.\\n[Coroner] Did you hear beds or tables being pulled about? - None whatever. I went asleep, and was awake again at five a.m. I passed down the stairs, and saw some men harnessing horses. At a quarter to six I was in the Ten Bells.\\n[Coroner] Could the witness, Mary Ann Cox, have come down the entry between one and half-past one o\\'clock without your knowledge ? - Yes, she could have done so.\\n[Coroner] Did you see any strangers at the Ten Bells ? - No. I went back to bed and slept until eleven.\\n[Coroner] You heard no singing downstairs ? - None whatever. I should have heard the singing distinctly. It was quite quiet at half-past one o\\'clock.\\nCaroline Maxewell, 14, Dorset-street, said: My husband is a lodging-house deputy. I knew the deceased for about four months. I believe she was an unfortunate. On two occasions I spoke to her.\\n[Coroner] Did you speak to her ? - Yes; it was an unusual thing to see her up. She was a young woman who never associated with any one. I spoke across the street, \"What, Mary, brings you up so early ?\" She said, \"Oh, Carrie, I do feel so bad.\"\\n[Coroner] And yet you say you had only spoken to her twice previously; you knew her name and she knew yours ? - Oh, yes; by being about in the lodging-house.\\n[Coroner] What did she say ? - She said, \"I\\'ve had a glass of beer, and I\\'ve brought it up again\"; and it was in the road. I imagined she had been in the Britannia beer-shop at the corner of the street. I left her, saying that I could pity her feelings. I went to Bishopsgate-street to get my husband\\'s breakfast. Returning I saw her outside the Britannia public-house, talking to a man.\\n[Coroner] This would be about what time ? - Between eight and nine o\\'clock. I was absent about half-an-hour. It was about a quarter to nine.\\n[Coroner] What description can you give of this man ? - I could not give you any, as they were at some distance.\\n[Coroner] What sort of dress had the deceased ? - A dark skirt, a velvet body, a maroon shawl, and no hat.\\n[Coroner] Have you ever seen her the worse for drink ? - I have seen her in drink, but she was not a notorious character.\\nSarah Lewis deposed: I live at 24, Great Pearl-street, and am a laundress. I know Mrs. Keyler, in Miller\\'s-court, and went to her house at 2, Miller\\'s-court, at 2.30a.m. on Friday. It is the first house. I noticed the time by the Spitalfields\\' Church clock. When I went into the court, opposite the lodging-house I saw a man with a wideawake. There was no one talking to him. He was a stout-looking man, and not very tall. The hat was black. I did not take any notice of his clothes. The man was looking up the court; he seemed to be waiting or looking for some one. Further on there was a man and woman - the later being in drink. There was nobody in the court. I dozed in a chair at Mrs. Keyler\\'s, and woke at about half- past three. I heard the clock strike.\\n[Coroner] What woke you up ? - I could not sleep. I sat awake until nearly four, when I heard a female\\'s voice shouting \"Murder\" loudly. It seemed like the voice of a young woman. It sounded at our door. There was only one scream.\\n[Coroner] Were you afraid ? Did you wake anybody up ? - No, I took no notice, as I only heard the one scream.\\n[Coroner] You stayed at Keyler\\'s house until what time ? - Half-past five p.m. on Friday. The police would not let us out of the court.\\n[Coroner] Have you seen any suspicious persons in the district ? - On Wednesday night I was going along the Bethnal-green-road, with a woman, about eight o\\'clock, when a gentleman passed us. He followed us and spoke to us, and wanted us to follow him into an entry. He had a shiny leather bag with him.\\n[Coroner] Did he want both of you ? - No; only one. I refused. He went away and came back again, saying he would treat us. He put down his bag and picked it up again, saying, \"What are you frightened about ? Do you think I\\'ve got anything in the bag ?\" We then ran away, as we were frightened.\\n[Coroner] Was he a tall man ? - He was short, pale-faced, with a black moustache, rather small. His age was about forty.\\n[Coroner] Was it a large bag ? - No, about 6in to 9in long. His hat was a high round hat. He had a brownish overcoat, with a black short coat underneath. His trousers were a dark pepper-and- salt.\\n[Coroner] After he left you what did you do ? - We ran away.\\n[Coroner] Have you seen him since ? - On Friday morning, about half-past two a.m., when I was going to Miller\\'s-court, I met the same man with a woman in Commercial-street, near Mr. Ringer\\'s public-house (the Britannia). He had no overcoat on.\\n[Coroner] Had he the black bag ? - Yes.\\n[Coroner] Were the man and woman quarrelling ? - No; they were talking. As I passed he looked at me. I don\\'t know whether he recognised me. There was no policeman about.\\nMr. George Bagster Phillips, divisional surgeon of police, said: I was called by the police on Friday morning at eleven o\\'clock, and on proceeding to Miller\\'s-court, which I entered at 11.15, I found a room, the door of which led out of the passage at the side of 26, Dorset-street, photographs of which I produce. It had two windows in the court. Two panes in the lesser window were broken, and as the door was locked I looked through the lower of the broken panes and satisfied myself that the mutilated corpse lying on the bed was not in need of any immediate attention from me, and I also came to the conclusion that there was nobody else upon the bed, or within view, to whom I could render any professional assistance. Having ascertained that probably it was advisable that no entrance should be made into the room at that time, I remained until about 1.30p.m., when the door was broken open by McCarthy, under the direction of Superintendent Arnold. On the door being opened it knocked against a table which was close to the left-hand side of the bedstead, and the bedstead was close against the wooden partition. The mutilated remains of a woman were lying two- thirds over, towards the edge of the bedstead, nearest the door. Deceased had only an under- linen garment upon her, and by subsequent examination I am sure the body had been removed, after the injury which caused death, from that side of the bedstead which was nearest to the wooden partition previously mentioned. The large quantity of blood under the bedstead, the saturated condition of the palliasse, pillow, and sheet at the top corner of the bedstead nearest to the partition leads me to the conclusion that the severance of the right carotid artery, which was the immediate cause of death, was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the bedstead and her head and neck in the top right-hand corner.\\nthe coroner said: It has come to my ears that somebody has been making a statement to some of the jury as to their right and duty of being here. Has any one during the interval spoken to the jury, saying that they should not be here to-day ?\\nJulia Vanturney [Van Turney], 1, Miller\\'s-court, a charwoman, living with Harry Owen, said: I knew the deceased for some time as Kelly, and I knew Joe Barnett, who lived with her. He would not allow her to go on the streets. Deceased often got drunk. She said she was fond of another man, also named Joe. I never saw this man. I believe he was a costermonger.\\n[Coroner] When did you last see the deceased alive ? - On Thursday morning, at about ten o\\'clock. I slept in the court on Thursday night, and went to bed about eight. I could not rest at all during the night.\\n[Coroner] Did you hear any noises in the court ? - I did not. I heard no screams of \"Murder,\" nor any one singing.\\n[Coroner] Were you in the house when Joe Barnett called ? - Yes. I said, \"Well, Mary Jane, I shall not see you this evening again,\" and I left with her two men\\'s dirty shirts, a little boy\\'s shirt, a black overcoat, a black crepe bonnet with black satin strings, a pawn-ticket for a grey shawl, upon which 2s had been lent, and a little girls white petticoat.\\n[Coroner] Have you seen any of these articles since? - Yes; I saw the black overcoat in a room in the court on Friday afternoon.\\n[Coroner] Did the deceased ever speak to you about being afraid of any man ? - She did not.\\nInspector Beck, H Division, deposed that, having sent for the doctor, he gave orders to prevent any persons leaving the court, and he directed officers to make a search. He had not been aware that the deceased was known to the police.\\n[Coroner] Was it by your orders that the door was forced ? - No; I had an intimation from Inspector Beck that the bloodhounds had been sent for, and the reply had been received that they were on the way. Dr. Phillips was unwilling to force the door, as it would be very much better to test the dogs, if they were coming. We remained until about 1.30 p.m., when Superintendent Arnold arrived, and he informed me that the order in regard to the dogs had been countermanded, and he gave orders for the door to be forced. I agree with the medical evidence as to the condition of the room. I subsequently took an inventory of the contents of the room. There were traces of a large fire having been kept up in the grate, so much so that it had melted the spout of a kettle off. We have since gone through the ashes in the fireplace; there were remnants of clothing, a portion of a brim of a hat, and a skirt, and it appeared as if a large quantity of women\\'s clothing had been burnt.\\n[Coroner] Can you give any reason why they were burnt ? - I can only imagine that it was to make a light for the man to see what he was doing. There was only one small candle in the room, on the top of a broken wine-glass. An impression has gone abroad that the murderer took away the key of the room. Barnett informs me that it has been missing some time, and since it has been lost they have put their hand through the broken window, and moved back the catch. It is quite easy. There was a man\\'s clay pipe in the room, and Barnett informed me that he smoked it.\\n[Coroner] Is there anything further the jury ought to know ? - No; if there should be I can communicate with you, sir.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-25T04:55:47Z', 'url': 'https://www.casebook.org/official_documents/inquests/inquest_kelly.html'}\n","{'text': 'Weekend fun isn’t just for humans.

Luckily my mother often made her own from scratch, but I also had the commercial boxed mac and cheese as well. Personally I’ve always prefered stove top to baked. I know, it is controversial. There is something to that velvety sauce and soft texture. It is simple and concise.\\nHowever, as I grew up, the idea of making it from scratch seemed more and more improbable. So I leaned toward the box. Now I am not saying that something is bad if it is in a box but powdered things often don’t feel super healthy in the food realm. Especially if all you are adding to them is butter and hot sauce and maybe tuna from a can. Wait. What?\\nYes. I would like to take a moment to address something that we call “Shame Food.” What is Shame Food? Shame Food is food that you only feel comfortable eating in private. Far from any witnesses. My big Shame Food experience was when I was doing social work. I would work all day in a pretty intense environment and then commute home and my wife worked another 5-6 hours. So I would get home, eat something, and then take a nap. That thing became my Shame Food. It was inspired by a natural food company’s spicy mac and cheese. (It has since been discontinued.) I would make mac and cheese and add a lot of cheap hot sauce (this was before we had a sauce business) and a can of tuna. I would not even plate it. I would eat the whole thing out of the pot and then take a nap. I mean the nap wasn’t a choice. That box of noodles is meant to feed a family of four. Plus the amount of hot sauce I added meant I wasn’t really enjoying the meal as much as surviving it. I had to recoup.\\nThis recipe isn’t that dish. It is tied to that spicy boxed macaroni and cheese, that my wife introduced me to, and we would eat it together at a time that we didn’t eat much. Also the roots are a stove top mac and cheese. The kind where the only powder involved it mustard powder and the spice comes from a complex sauce with a bright balsamic flavor and a nutty essence that pairs well with the gruyere and trust me if you finish it with toasted sesame, you will not regret it. Please enjoy and feel free to share with us your Shame Food.\\nPour the pasta into a strainer and place the empty pot back on the stove.\\nTurn heat to medium and add the butter.\\nOnce the butter has melted, stir in the flour and use a whisk continue for a minute.\\nSlowly add the milk and cream while whisking to combine.\\nAdd the mustard powder and stir.\\nReduce heat to medium-low and add the mascarpone.

The 1,300- word statement was read out by the sitting President of UNSC Sebastiano Cardi, the Ambassador of Italy, at a formal UNSC session on Monday ( November 6, 2017) .\\nA presidential statement is a statement made by the President of the Security Council on behalf of the Council, adopted at a formal meeting of the Council and issued as an official document of the Council.\\nA Presidential Statement is often created when the United Nations Security Council cannot reach consensus or are prevented from passing a resolution by a permanent member’s veto, or threat thereof. Such statements are similar in content, format, and tone to resolutions, but are not legally binding. The adoption of a Presidential Statement requires consensus, although Security Council members may abstain. The Statement is signed by the sitting Security Council President.\\nIt was the first presidential statement in 10 years on Myanmar. The Security Council has adopted such statements against Myanmar only three times, with the last one coming a decade ago. Diplomats hailed the move as a unified international stand against a humanitarian crisis that has been called “ethnic cleansing” by the U.N., U.S., France and the U.K.\\nIt strongly condemned attacks against the Myanmar security forces carried out by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on August 25, and then expressed “grave concern” over the government’s response, the alleged burning of villages and threats to villagers to flee, among others.\\nIt called for reform in Myanmar’s security and justice sectors and urged the government to work with Bangladesh and the UN to allow the voluntary return of refugees to their homes, on the basis of an October 24 memorandum of understanding between the two country.\\nThe panel welcomed a “union enterprise mechanism” for humanitarian assistance, resettlement and development in Rakhine.\\nIt recommended the government ensure the mechanism supported such return and allow UN agencies full access, urging governments and all humanitarian partners to pay special attention to the needs of women, particular survivors of sexual violence.\\nThe council said the government’s primary responsibility is the protection of Myanmar’s population, citizens or not. The statement reiterated concerns and demands previously laid out: an end to excessive military force in Rakhine province, a lack of humanitarian access for the U.N., a right of return for refugees, and steps to address the root causes of the conflict. The statement included most of the demands contained in a draft resolution presented last month by Britain and France, but that measure ran into strong opposition from China, a supporter of Myanmar’s former ruling junta.\\nIt is said that, China had indicated it was willing to resort to its veto power to block a resolution, but Beijing finally agreed to a statement during negotiations.\\nThe action is one step below a Security Council resolution in diplomatic significance, but a step above the Council’s previous action, a “press statement,” in September.\\nThe statement requires the U.N. Secretary General António Guterres to report back to the Council within 30 days on Myanmar’s progress in addressing the Council’s demands. The statement isn’t as binding as a resolution would be, and carries no punitive measures, such as sanctions, if corrective steps aren’t taken.\\nThe Security Council has held a series of meetings on Myanmar since September, including a briefing attended by high-level officials on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly gathering. But efforts to respond forcefully have stalled despite widespread reports of deaths, rapes and torture of Rohingya Muslim minorities, including women and children, at the hands of the country’s military.\\nViolence erupted in August after a Rohingya militant group attacked Myanmar security forces. Since late August, more than 600,000 Rohingya have been driven from their homes by an army campaign that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing.\\nDuring negotiations with China, language on citizenship rights was watered down in the statement as was a demand that Myanmar allow a UN human rights mission into the country, diplomats said.\\nThe statement calls on Myanmar to cooperate with the United Nations and encourages UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to appoint a special advisor on Myanmar.\\nThe council statement was agreed as Guterres prepares to travel to Manila this week to join leaders of the Southeast Asian (ASEAN) bloc for a summit.\\nThe council also welcomed the Myanmar government’s public support for recommendations by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State chaired by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and called for their full implementation.\\nIt urged UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to consider appointing a special advisor on Myanmar.\\nSince the August attacks, over 604,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh. Some fled by land, others in boats over an inlet of the Bay of Bengal.\\nIn the last two weeks, 4,000 refugees entered Bangladesh while four people drowned in a shipwreck while fleeing, officials said.\\nU.K Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said: I am pleased that today (6 November) the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has spoken with one voice on the appalling situation in Rakhine State, Burma. The UK has repeatedly called on the Burmese security forces to protect all civilians and act now to stop the violence and allow humanitarian aid to urgently reach all those who need it. The UNSC has today joined us in that call, with this historic Presidential Statement on Burma.\\nI am encouraged to see State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi making important steps forward, including establishing a domestic body to deliver humanitarian and development assistance in Rakhine, and making efforts to promote interfaith and intercommunal harmony, including a recent visit to northern Rakhine. The UK will be watching closely to ensure that the Burmese security forces do not attempt to frustrate these efforts.\\nThe U.K. and France initially circulated a proposed Security Council resolution on Myanmar in late October, but China and Russia refused to engage and negotiate, diplomats said. China finally agreed to a similar text with minor changes as a presidential statement—which carries less weight than a resolution—and Russia followed suit.\\nMr. Guterres has been outspoken about the Myanmar crisis and urged the Security Council to prevent continued bloodshed and curb the refugee flow. Mr. Guterres will be among the world leaders attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit later this week in Manila.\\nThe Rohingya refugee crisis is expected to be a top issue of discussion at the summit, to be attended by US President Donald Trump, who will dispatch US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Myanmar later this month. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will also attend that summit.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-22T08:53:33Z', 'url': 'https://www.rohingyalanguage.com/2018/02/un-security-issues-presidential-statement-on-myanmar-10-years-later.html'}\n","{'text': 'In the past five years the percentage of weekly mobile banking users has more than tripled — from 9% in 2010 to 30% in 2015 — while weekly branch visitors fell from 40% to 24% in the same time frame. 2015 marked the first time that weekly mobile bankers (30%) exceeded branch bankers (24%) in Javelin’s survey. “What is driving this incredible growth? Smartphones and tablets are gaining rapidly in consumer adoption but it’s also a function of the fact that mobile banking services have not only proliferated but increased in the quality and features they offer consumers,” said Javelin analyst Daniel Van Dyke during a January 27 webinar reviewing the firm’s Mobile Banking, Smartphone and Tablet Forecast.\\nJavelin’s recent report Digital Account Opening Reaches The Tipping Point also found that more Americans are applying for credit cards, loans and investment products through digital channels than physical ones. Javelin has argued that “FIs that fail to divert resources from branch to digital suffer a large opportunity cost, missing out in lowered servicing costs for basic transactions and in sales of new products.” The service costs argument rings particularly true for mobile deposit, with Chase citing a cost of 65 cents for each teller deposit vs only 3 cents using mobile. While 38 percent of big bank customers utilize mobile deposit, only 18 percent of community bank and 16 percent of credit union customers do, placing these institutions at a significant disadvantage in terms of service costs.\\nThe branch network, which peaked at 99,550 U.S. locations in 2009, has dropped each year since. The latest FDIC figure of 93,283 represents a 6.3 percent decline in the last six years, although Bryan Yurcan of American Banker was quick to point out that \"most of that reduction has come with the nation\\'s largest banks shedding inventory ... many smaller banks have held steady, and even increased, branch numbers.\"\\nPredicting that account maintenance will increasingly be performed on mobile devices but there will be times that customers seek face-to-face advice, Schwanhausser said FIs need to \"get into the business where they\\'re influencing the behavior of their customers, guiding them to a smarter way to manage their finances. Those are very personal kinds of conversations. It\\'s not about eliminating (the branch) but how do we put the pieces together in a more coherent way?\"\\nWhile early adopters of smartwatches tend to be affluent or part of Gen Y2 (ages 25-34), mobile bankers no longer carry such unique characteristics. As Van Dyke put it, \"The mobile banker of today is the banking customer of today. They\\'re becoming indistinguishable.\" Mobile banking has become so commonplace that Javelin projects 80 percent of consumers will be engaging in it — on a 90 day basis — by 2020.\\nIn 2015 74 percent of mobile banking users employed an app and 69 percent utilized a mobile browser, dwarfing the 31 percent using SMS text messaging. Schwanhausser said FIs will continue to wrestle with the question of what to make available in the app: \"Do you make it fine tuned and focused and streamlined or replicate what can be viewed in online banking?\" Van Dyke predicts that banks will continue to take advantage of device-specific capabilities, whether using the camera for mobile deposit or geolocation to identify nearby ATMs. \"Things like that will underscore the need to offer superior experiences on the app,\" said Van Dyke.\\n2015 marked a continuation of Android\\'s dominance, as the operating system grew its share of the U.S. tablet market from 45 to 48 percent and its share of the U.S. smartphone market from 47 to 49 percent. Apple\\'s tablet share fell from 46 to 43 percent, with its smartphone share dropping from 46 to 45 percent. While Apple\\'s numbers have been moving in the wrong direction Van Dyke reiterated that iOS users are the most valuable that an FI can serve. \"iPhone users show extremely unique characteristics. They bank more often, they make payments more often,\" said Van Dyke. \"When it comes to banks and payment providers iPhone owners are the gold standard.\" In addition to serving Android users, Javelin recommended that FIs prioritize an app on Amazon — but only after all iOS and Android device types have been addressed. Javelin suggested that there was no value in supporting Windows or Blackberry users, who only represent 4 and 2 percent of the smartphone market respectively.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-23T09:10:27Z', 'url': 'https://www.mx.com/moneysummit/mobile-banking-outpaces-branch-for-the-first-time'}\n","{'text': 'Well it\\'s been a funny few days.

Great! Now, of course, you need to become their editor. Here is where some find a challenge in the natural approach to language arts. What if I don’t feel competent to edit my child’s writing? We’ll address the underlying problem with that argument further down, but for now — here are 10 ways to become a better editor of your child’s writing.\\n1. Read A Strong Start in Language.\\nThis Ruth Beechick title for beginning grades is recommended widely — from The Well-Trained Mind to Sonlight. Typically packaged as part of The Three Rs, A Strong Start in Language helps you become the editor from the beginning — from the time your child traces his first letters, to copywork, and through dictation. Read our full review (scroll down).\\n2. Read You Can Teach Your Child Successfully.\\nOver 100 pages are devoted to writing in this followup to the Three Rs by Ruth Beechick mentioned above. The book speaks to you as your child’s tutor and therefore includes writing activities, writing lessons to get you started and that you can pattern your own lessons after, and suggestions for usage, grammar, mechanics, and spelling. Best of all it tells you what you can expect from your child at various levels on the writing scale. Very valuable reference to finding your way as you teach writing naturally to your children and we cannot recommend it highly enough. You can read our full review (scroll down).\\n3. Use Learning Grammar Through Writing.\\nThis handy reference published by Educators Publishing Service is now out of print. But it is worth finding. When you find a mistake in your child’s writing, you can find the coordinating pithy rule with an example to have your child copy into a grammar notebook. A checklist at the back helps you keep track of the skills you have covered.\\nThe best way to improve your editing is to read good writing. While you work through the suggestions above, you can be building your foundation in good writing at the same time.\\n5. Make use of a dictionary.\\nBefore the days of Kindle we had electronic dictionaries handy that included a grammar reference. Although somewhat pricey, the better models not only include the definitions, but also the etymology of the word. Most also come with a built-in thesaurus and other tools. If nothing else, a good dictionary can shed some light on how words are properly used in sentences.\\nNot popular with some, but a valuable skill for understanding how words work in sentences. There are easy online courses that can help you quickly learn the basics. For simple and easy practice we like The Complete Book of Diagrams by Mary Daily published by The Riggs Institute Press, which also is a great help for Mom.\\n7. Use Learn to Write the Novel Way.\\nWhile your child writes his novel as he works through this book, you have a guide that helps you edit your child’s writing. Learn by doing. Read our full review.\\n8. Read The Elements of Style.\\nThis widely recommended classic by Strunk and White holds the title for the most concise and simple usage, composition, and spelling reference. There is even an early version in the public domain.\\n9. Read How to Write Clearly by Ruth Beechick.\\nSubtitled, The Meaning Approach, this is another handy writing reference that covers finding a topic, getting organized, outlining, using abstract and concrete terms, sentences, comma usage, active and passive voice, choosing words, usage, and more! Read our full review.\\nIt’s never too late. Having a working knowledge of how Latin works is probably one of the best ways to understand how the English language works.\\nYou will also want a grammar reference. Our favorite grammar reference is the Handbook of Grammar and Composition published by A Beka. We purchased it on a recommendation in The Well-Trained Mind and haven’t looked back.\\nNow, back to the initial question: what if you don’t feel competent to edit your child’s writing? You do know how to write, yes? In this day of streaming output you may even write for a blog or other publication. Using the ideas above, you should be able to stay ahead of your child’s work. Of course, at some point, if you feel you are losing ground there are many qualified and reputable online writing tutors available.\\nWhat to have your child do.\\nMore structure for those who need it.\\nWhere to put the writing.\\nYou’ll also want to have your child keep one of these.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-24T14:59:16Z', 'url': 'https://diyhomeschooler.com/2016/01/20/10-ways-to-become-a-better-editor/'}\n","{'text': 'Definitely my favorite restaurant in Macau.

It not only empowers them but also has a positive effect on their family and surroundings. Women with more education tend to have fewer children, which benefits them, their families and the society at large. Education is also one of the most powerful elements of improving people’s health. It saves the lives of millions of mothers and children, helps prevent diseases, and is an essential component of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Educated mothers are better informed about diseases; therefore, they take preventative measures, recognize signs of illness early and tend to use health care services more often.\\nTo create awareness regarding the importance of girl child eductaion, SOC Films in collaboration with Chime of Change, created a series of short documentaries on young girls who want to achieve their dreams and aspirations to seek excellence in various professions in future whether it's sports, literature, science, math, activism, or so on and so forth. Chime for Change, a global movement is aimed at strengthening voices speaking out to support the cause of promoting justice, health and education for girls and women the world over. These documentaries were screened at an event in New York on 11th October this year, which is also celebrated as the International Day of the Girl Child.

The Pokemon figures are pretty hard to make into a cake so I decided to make the Pokeball, which is just a round ball, half red & half white.\\nI’ve been wanting to try my hand at decorating a cake with fondant after washing billions of hours of Charm City Cakes’ amazing creations and ‘the Cake Boss’. Obviously this would not be anywhere in the same league as the cakes they create, but you have to start somewhere, right?\\nI have to say that even after making the fondant, I was still surprised at how heavy it was when it came down to decorating the cake. It’s not like pie dough where you can roll it onto itself and move it. You actually need to decide ahead of time to bring the cake closer to you. I found this out after having finally kneaded the fondant so it was just right and then rolling it to just the right thickness and then trying to get it to my cake… And having it rip apart and fall on the floor… Thus having to start all over with a new piece. And I did this TWICE before moving the cake. Ugh. Sometimes my brain doesn’t work!\\nAnyway, once I moved the cake and got a feel for the fondant, it went pretty smoothly.\\nThen I went to add the final touches, which I thought would be the easiest part… I had that icing in a can with the writing tips. That’s what I used for the black lines I needed. It came out in globs and made a mess. Then I tried to ‘fix’ it by making another line so maybe it would look like it was supposed to be thicker. It looked awful! Oh well. It was black, it’s not like I could take it back off and start over (the fondant instantly took on the color!). I decided to just be happy the fondant worked.\\nBut then, because I can’t just leave well enough alone, I had to write on the cake. I used that same icing in a can, this time in blue. Maybe it’s just me. I don’t think I can write on cakes. The writing was awful and I was very upset about it. I do have a really nice set of cake decorating tips so next time I’ll see if I can do any better with the decorations using homemade icing.\\nThe actual cake was just a white box cake, I made a blue and a green layer and then I cut each layer in two so it would be a 4-layer cake. I made a delicious vanilla buttercream to frost it. I also added a layer of sprinkles :). I wish I could post a pic of the inside but it was so late after trick-or-treating last night, it never got cut!\\nI think I’m going to go eat the leftover vanilla buttercream!', 'timestamp': '2019-04-21T22:56:16Z', 'url': 'https://natalietriestocook.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/fondant-covered-pokemon-cake/'}\n","{'text': 'Funding for scholarships is in accordance with Georgia’s unclaimed property laws, O.C.G.A. § 44-12-236.

It is my all time favorite cat Christmas photo, so I share it yearly.\\nPoinsettias are poisonous if cats eat them, so it’s not the best photo to share because of that. However, my mom has never had a cat bother a poinsettia – so she always left them out.

The fresh vegetables and fruit are so colorful and succulent, who can resist eating these vibrant beauties? Our bodies thrive on raw plant-based foods. I think this is why our creator made fruits and vegetables look soo enticing! Asking yourself “How can I get this more of these beauties into my diet?” Then follow me over the next few weeks because I will be preparing raw plant-based recipes. Summer is the best time to set started – you’ll beat the heat (in and out of the kitchen) and eat seasonally at the same time!\\nThis beautiful summer salad will brighten up any meal. Great with peaches or try cherries, nectarines or plums!\\nOver the years, I have been trying to incorporate more raw foods into my diet and here’s why: I want to stay feeling and looking young, and free of disease. Plant-based foods are the best sources of disease-fighting antioxidants, inflammation-fighting polyphenols, and a host of nourishing vitamins and minerals and I want to load my body up with that protective goodness!\\nBut a completely raw diet can be complicated and expensive. And I am a busy, working mom who’s a foodie, to boot. My goal is to find ways to easily prepare and enjoy more live raw food as a way of adding more healing nourishment into my diet. You don’t have to eat 100% raw to feel the energizing benefits. But it does take a shift in how and what foods you prepare. All you need is a little know-how to get started. Here are the steps that I took to get started.\\nIt’s tempting to make a drastic dietary change because we just want to feel better NOW. I commend your enthusiasm but remember, it is better to start small and follow through, then go big and get overwhelmed and give up. Choose one thing and stick with it. Try adding a green smoothie to your morning routine or swapping out your regular lunch for a big, raw salad. Once you’ve made this first step a part of your routine, add something else. These little steps will lead to big health changes over time.\\nWhen starting a new way of eating, it’s common to focus on what you are losing. Instead, concentrate on what power foods you can add to enhance the nutritional value of each meal. Eating more plant-based foods may encourage you to experiment with different cuisines, along with new herbs and spices. Yum, yum! Don’t worry about what you’ll need to give up. Focus on what you’re gaining: flavor, nutrition and energy.\\nNo need to over-complicate and feel stressed out! Start by sticking to the basics: smoothies, soups, salads, slaws. Over time, you will expand your collection of delicious, healthful, amazing raw plant-based recipes.\\nFind a day that works for you and take 30-40 minutes to prepare your fruits and veggies for the week ahead. Grate veggies (carrots, radishes, zucchini) for salads. Cut and freeze fruit for smoothies. Make staples to keep on hand (salad dressings, hummus, cooked grains). A little work today will help you make healthier choices all week long!\\nIdeally, every Sunday you have all of your meals planned and veggies prepped. Sound too hard? Start by planning two or three recipes for the week. I like to keep a folder of “recipes to try” in my kitchen for inspiration. Save time with leftovers and always keep raw snacks like nuts and apples with you. A little planning does the trick!\\nHere is a salad to get you started: it can be used for a side at dinner or bring it the next day for lunch by adding it to a wrap with hummus. It will keep nicely and actually tastes better the next day!\\nSo try adding some raw, plant-based dishes to your meal plan this week! I’ll be back next week with some more ideas and delicious recipes to help you moving forward towards a healthier, plant-based, deliciously raw table!', 'timestamp': '2019-04-25T08:56:20Z', 'url': 'https://theenergizedbody.com/adding-raw-plant-based-meals/'}\n","{'text': \"Road map for PM Modi's complete road-show.

The Carolina Hurricanes have drawn the first wildcard spot and will face the Metropolitan Division-leading Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. The New York Islanders will be the second seed in the Metro and will have to square off against the Pittsburgh Penguins. In the Atlantic Division, the Columbus Blue Jackets end up with a tough match-up as they will face the Tampa Bay Lightning, while the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs will meet once again, as everyone has known about for quite some time. The final results of the night will determine how the Western Conference Shakes out.\\nThe Colorado Avalanche’s Mikko Rantanen was spotted on the ice Saturday in San Jose wearing a non-contact jersey, according to The Athletic’s Ryan S. Clark. The injured forward, who hasn’t seen action since March 21st with an undisclosed injury, traveled with the team but will sit out once again. While that doesn’t sound like great news, considering the playoffs are right around the corner it is better to have him skating than not. If Colorado has any chance of advancing out of the first round, they will need their young scorer. The 22-year-old will have played eight less games than last year, but has a career high 31 goals and 87 points in his sophomore season. Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said later today that he is hopeful that Rantanen will be available for the playoffs, according to BSN’s Adrian Dater.\\nSpeaking of injuries, the Pittsburgh Penguins got some good news as defenseman Brian Dumoulin skated on his own after missing the past three games with a lower-body injury, according to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Dumoulin, who normally skates alongside Kris Letang, would make a big impact on a lineup that is preparing for the playoffs and could use the player tied for fifth in the NHL with a +31 rating. “The fact that Dumo is on the ice is really encouraging from our standpoint,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. He added that the injury isn’t considered major and Doumolin remains day-to-day.\\nThe St. Louis Blues expect to get back defenseman Colton Parayko, who has sat out the past two games with an undisclosed injury. The 25-year-old defender is expected to play in the playoffs, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch’s Jim Thomas. Thomas added that Tyler Bozak was just held out for precautionary reasons Saturday after he was in a car accident getting to the game. The veteran center was rear-ended, but wasn’t seriously hurt. He too is expected back for the playoff opener.\\nAs the Blackhawks pass through another disappointing season, the team must continue to focus on development. The team has a nice group of prospects coming up the pipeline, but there are many that are starting to worry about whether the Blackhawks are doing the right thing with defenseman Henri Jokiharju, their 2017 first-rounder.\\nThe Blackhawks, not known for developing defensemen recently, loaned Jokiharju out to Finland for the World Junior Championships, against the youngster’s wishes even though they eventually won the gold medal. Since his return, the team has changed course in his development, moving him over to the left side, his off-side which will help make room next season for right-hand shot Adam Boqvist, and has had his ice-time cut, according to The Athletic’s Scott Powers (subscription required). He even was a healthy scratch recently.\\nHead coach Jeremy Colliton said the changes are being made to make sure the youngster won’t burn out like many rookies do during their first season.\\nThe Colorado Avalanche suffered a key loss Saturday as the team will be without defenseman Erik Johnson, who suffered a concussion during their game against Los Angeles. The veteran defenseman is expected to be out for the next two games and head coach Jared Bednar hopes he’ll be back after the All-Star break, according to The Athletic’s Ryan S. Clark. The defensive-minded blueliner averages 21:42 of ATOI and is a key figure on the team’s defense.\\nThe Avalanche also had good news in practice as defensive prospect Conor Timmins, who has missed all of the 2018-19 season so far with a concussion, practiced today with the team even if it was in a non-contact jersey, according to BSN’s AJ Haefele. Bednar said after the practice that Timmins will begin ramping up activities over the next couple of weeks and they will see if he’s ready to go when the team returns after the All-Star break. Timmins, the team’s second-round pick in 2017, could help the team down the stretch if he’s deemed ready.\\nTed Wyman of the Winnipeg Sun looks back at the first half of the season now that the team hits their bye and All-Star week, suggesting that while many things have gone right for the Jets, perhaps the most disappointing part of the season has been the play of star forward Patrik Laine. The scribe writes that the third-year winger is having a miserable season despite having 25 goals at this point. Despite an 18-goal November, Laine has tallied just seven goals combined in the other three months and often looks like a rookie on the ice. Of course, he’s only 20 years old still, so patience is needed.\\nAfter struggling for much of the season and recently seeing his ice time dwindle, Tyson Jost is headed back to the AHL. The Colorado Avalanche today assigned Jost and Ryan Graves to the Colorado Eagles, giving them just 21 players on the roster.\\nJost, 20, was the tenth overall pick in 2016 but has yet to really establish himself in the NHL. After a great freshmen season at the University of North Dakota, the offensive center signed his entry-level contract and made his debut down the stretch for the Avalanche. Last year he returned to the lineup full-time and recorded 22 points in 65 games, but has failed to really take a step forward in 2018-19. Jost hasn’t been asked to play center on a regular basis this season given his struggles in the faceoff circle, and it’s not clear exactly where he fits into the lineup in a perfect scenario.\\nThat fit will have to be determined through his play in the minor leagues, as the young forward was clearly not progressing in the NHL. In 43 games he has just 15 points, despite being given ample opportunities on the powerplay for much of the year. Given that he does not penalty kill and is seeing fewer than ten minutes of even-strength ice time in recent weeks, playing in a top-six role for the Eagles is probably the best for his development. Jost can obviously be recalled at a moment’s notice given the proximity of the AHL team, and currently does not require waivers.\\nGraves meanwhile could be back up before the Avalanche hit the ice on Saturday against the Los Angeles Kings, but he too had been used extremely sparingly by head coach Jared Bednar during his time in the NHL. The 23-year old defenseman has logged fewer than 12 minutes of ice time in each of his eight appearances, though he does have two goals already to show for his short NHL career.\\nPoll: Should Colorado Move Semyon Varlamov?\\nThe Colorado Avalanche returned third-string goalie Pavel Francouz to the AHL today. Yet, at this point in their season, it is fair to ask whether that move actually makes the team better. The Avs finally snapped a six-game win-less streak on Friday night against the New York Rangers and have fallen out of the once-competitive Central Division race over the past month. Colorado’s struggles are not singular in nature – a lack of secondary scoring and a struggling penalty kill have played a part – but poor performance in net has been the most pressing issue facing the team. After a hot start to the season, Semyon Varlamov has regressed to a .912 save percentage and 2.80 GAA and has missed the team’s past two games with a lower-body injury. Off-season acquisition Philipp Grubauer has yet to settle in with Colorado, holding a career-worst .902 save percentage and 3.13 GAA thus far.\\nConsidering that Varlamov’s play is not currently winning games for the Avalanche, the team could opt to move on from the veteran keeper. Despite Varlamov’s recent slump, the impending unrestricted free agent would still be a valued name on the trade market as the NHL Trade Deadline grows closer. Several teams will be looking for a rental for the stretch run and postseason and Varlamov could potentially be the closest thing to a bona fide starter that could hit the market. Why then would the playoff-bound Avalanche want to move Varlamov if he’s still a top NHL option? The return would be substantial and could – either directly or by flipping part of the return – result in Colorado adding the forward depth they so desperately need. It was recently reported that the Avs are hesitant to move their top prospects and young roster players for help, which could force them to move an established veteran like Varlamov.\\nThe Avalanche could benefit from some addition by subtraction when it comes to Varlamov as well. The aforementioned Francouz, in his first season in North America after an illustrious European career, has made the transition look easy this season. Recently named an AHL All-Star, Francouz, 28, has a .919 save percentage and 2.65 GAA through 23 games with the Colorado Eagles. Perhaps more impressively, Francouz has made two NHL relief appearances and has saved 33 of the 35 shots that he faced (.943 SV%). The Denver Post’s Sean Keeler writes that head coach Jared Bednar considered making Francouz the starter over Grubauer last night and opined that the current third-string could be the X-factor for the Avs this season. Francouz is also an impending UFA and the team should take a longer look at him this season to determine if he could be a long-term option alongside Gruabauer. An extended stay in Denver this season would certainly help convince Francouz to stick around as well.\\nOf course, if the Avalanche were to trade Varlamov this season, it would very likely hurt their chances at a Stanley Cup title. Despite his struggles, Varlamov has outplayed Grubauer and has years of success to fall back on, as opposed to his young backup and Francouz, an unproven import. Colorado would likely have to turn around and add another option in net if they were to trade Varlamov. However, given that the Avs face a probable playoff route through the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets this season, it could be that they favor improving the team for the future rather than clinging to slim title chances. The team could also feel that addressing their needs at forward is a priority compared to maintaining depth in net.\\nWhat do you think? Should the Avalanche change things up by trading Varlamov for young pieces or forward help and hand the reins to Grubauer and Francouz? Or should they hold on to their established starter in hopes that it is their best chance at a Cup run this season?\\nThe Colorado Avalanche announced they have recalled goaltender Pavel Francouz from the Colorado Eagles of the AHL. Head coach Jared Bednar said that Semyon Varlamov was a little banged up and Francouz was recalled as a precaution. The 28-year-old was up earlier this month and was impressive in a relief stint on Dec. 22 when he saved 21 of 22 shots against Arizona in 29 minutes of work. Francouz, who signed as a free agent with Colorado in the offseason out of the KHL has performed well in the AHL as well, posting a 13-7-1 record and a .919 save percentage. With Varlamov expected to hit free agency at the end of the season, Francouz could be a strong candidate to fill the backup role next season.\\nThe Carolina Hurricanes have assigned forward Janne Kuokkanen to the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL, according to CapFriendly. The 20-year-old prospect has had trouble finding a positive role with the Hurricanes, despite being dominant in the AHL. Kuokkanen has yet to score in seven games and has seen his playing time dwindle to under 10 minutes in the past three games. He will return to Charlotte where he has already equaled his goal output from last year and can continue working on his game. The team followed that up announcing the promotion of Saku Maenalanen from Charlotte to fill Kuokkanen’s shoes. Maenalanen has appeared in just one game for the Hurricanes, but has scored seven goals and 14 points in 31 games for the Checkers.\\nWhile it’s already been reported that the Chicago Blackhawks’ recent trade acquisition Jason Garrison cleared waivers earlier today, NBC Sports Charlie Roumeliotis reports that Blackhawks’ general manager Stan Bowman said Garrison will be assigned to the Rockford Ice Hogs of the AHL. Garrison, picked up in Sunday’s trade with Drake Caggulia for Brandon Manning, has played in 17 games with the Oilers this year. He did play 58 games with the Chicago Wolves last season when playing for the Vegas franchise.\\nAfter two years in the Swiss League, former NHLer Bobby Sanguinetti has returned to North America, as the Charlotte Checkers of the AHL announced they have signed the 30-year-old veteran to an AHL deal. The defenseman, who played 45 games with the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes, played with the Checkers for three years before spending the last two years in Switzerland. Sanguinetti, a former first-round pick in 2006, will hope to resurrect his career there.\\nThe Nashville Predators announced they have assigned Nicholas Baptiste to the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL. The team recalled him Monday to serve as an emergency player for their game against Washington, but now have returned the 23-year-old without getting him into a game. Baptiste has played 34 games for Milwaukee and has six goals and 14 points.\\nThe Minnesota Wild have recalled defenseman Ryan Murphy from AHL Iowa per a team release. This will be the 25-year-old’s first stint in the NHL this season but he has 172 games of NHL experience between Carolina and Minnesota over the past six seasons. Murphy has played in 27 games in the minors this season with three goals and 10 assists.\\nThe Colorado Avalanche went out of its way to bring in goaltender Philipp Grubauer via trade during the offseason to be their heir apparent in goal, but with Semyon Varlamov playing well throughout this season, Grubauer hasn’t had much of a chance to claim that role. However, that might be changing.\\nWith the team having lost five of their last seven games and Varlamov struggling, the team got a brilliant performance from Grubauer on Tuesday as he saved 35 shots in a 2-1 win over the Montreal Canadiens. After that performance, The Athletic’s Ryan S. Clark (subscription required) wonders if this is the turning point where Grubauer takes over as the team’s No. 1 goaltender. With Varlamov slated to hit unrestricted free agency this summer, the team needs for Grubauer to take that next step and that looks to be the case. In the last six starts (not including Friday’s 2-1 loss to Chicago), the 27-year-old is 5-0-1 with a 2.29 GAA and a .936 save percentage.\\n“(Grubauer) gives us a chance. He gives us a real good chance,” head coach Jared Bednar said. “He keeps it at 1-0 and guys are saying the right things on the bench. … I just felt like he looked really solid in the net. Like he was in control tonight. I haven’t felt that way about our goaltending for the last little bit and that’s what we need.\\nThe Athletic’s Scott Powers (subscription required) writes that when winger Brendan Perlini was traded from the Arizona Coyotes to Chicago Blackhawks, he had high hopes that a change of scenery would jumpstart his career as he has struggled to put up points. However, while the Blackhawks liked what they have seen from center Dylan Strome, Perlini quickly found himself on the team’s fourth line and even found himself a healthy scratch early on. “To be honest, you never like to sit, but it’s good because I can watch the game and say, OK, here’s certain spots where maybe I can get the puck or things like that or realize watching I can settle down there, there’s a lot more time than I actually think. Like I said, you never like watching, but you can take good things from it. I think I’ve done that and just try to build off it and learn every day.” Perlini since then has looked much more comfortable and has picked up a couple of goals in the past four games. The hope is he continues to make adjustments in Chicago’s lineup.\\nKen Wiebe of the Winnipeg Sun writes that with the impressive play shown by Winnipeg Jets’ goaltender Laurent Brossoit can be attributed back to last year when the back-up lost his job in Edmonton to Al Montoya and he found himself in the AHL for the remainder of the season. That experience made him work harder to get back to the NHL. “Now I’m more aware of who I am as a goalie and as a professional, if that makes any sense,” said Brossoit. “It was unfortunate I had to go through those growing pains during my biggest opportunity with that club. I wouldn’t say that I performed at the level I normally do.” Brossoit was offered to return to Edmonton, but instead opted to start fresh in Winnipeg.\\nThe NHL has issued a $2,000 fine to Colorado Avalanche forward Mikko Rantanen, citing two instances in which he broke Rule 64 for Diving/Embellishment this season. Fines will increase for Rantanen for any subsequent instances, and eventually include financial punishment to head coach Jared Bednar as well. The first incident, which garnered just a warning, was on October 16th against the New York Rangers, while the latest was during a November 14th game against the Boston Bruins.\\nRantanen has been one of the league’s brightest stars this season and still leads the entire NHL in scoring with 32 points. His play alongside Nathan MacKinnon has been a revelation, and has the Avalanche poised to become one of the league’s most dangerous offensive teams. Unfortunately with this history, he’ll now be watched even more closely by the officials and may not get the benefit of the doubt on close calls. He also could very well draw the ire of his coaching staff if he causes them to be fined, or costs his team with an ill-timed penalty.\\nWith a dominant top line that includes Nathan MacKinnon, Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen, the Colorado Avalanche can’t be happier as they have combined for 75 points so far this season. However, the biggest concern for the team has been their secondary scoring, which most recently seems to have improved when the team re-inserted center Tyson Jost together with wingers Alex Kerfoot and Colin Wilson, according to Kyle Newman of the Denver Post.\\nJost had spent some time with that line earlier this year, but between a demotion to the team’s fourth line and an injury that kept him out for four games, Jost finally got a chance to center the two wingers and has made the most of his opportunity with a pair of goals in the past week as well as improved play from both Wilson and Kerfoot.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-26T02:31:08Z', 'url': 'https://www.prohockeyrumors.com/coaches/jared-bednar'}\n","{'text': 'Justice studies is an interdisciplinary area that blends topics from humanities departments (e.g., philosophy), social science departments (e.g., psychology, sociology, women’s studies), departments that include both humanities and social science faculty (e.g., history, political science), and professionally-oriented departments (education, family studies, social work).

The Timmins native hopped on Twitter on Wednesday to announce that her album is already platinum in Canada!\\nShortly after the release of the lead single “Life’s About to Get Good,” it hit number one on the Billboard 200. Of course, fans were simply dying to see how their favourite country icon was doing, so the new single rocked its way to the top of Billboard + Twitter Trending 140, too!

The poll showed that in the swing state of Ohio, Trump would garner 15 percent of the African American vote against Clinton, with another 11 percent undecided.\\nThat is huge increase from the 4 percent of the black vote Mitt Romney received in Ohio during the last presidential election.\\nWell, well, well, even the ex-Obama-Czar-self-proclaimed communist understands and sees how Trump can win and be our next President! Wow! I’m a bit impressed, but I wouldn’t trust Van Jones with a lollipop either! Trump is pulling in some of the more modest democrats over to vote for him, and with the help of these two infamous Internet sensations, Diamond and Silk, created a place for them to do just that, called “Ditch and Switch”, for anyone who either voted democrat all these horrible years and now sees the “light” in voting Trump, or whom never voted before and wants to sign up as soon as possible to exercise their constitutional right to vote, they can go to Diamond and Silk’s website, and sign up. They can help direct you to the right place. Thanks, Van Jones, for your analysis of a Trump win, and he can do this, if every ethnic group would just open their eyes to see what the last 7 years have really done to them; not for the “freebies” they get, for as long as they are listed poor, they can get the freebies, but is that what you really want? Just the freebies that this administration “gives” you? And where do you think that money comes from? Thin air? The upper clouds? Take heed, people, realize, that in history, in other parts of the world, where “freebies” were a given because the people were poor and destitute, they were “controlled” by that government as long as they did the government’s bidding, they got the freebies, so they just didn’t work or even try looking. Then the government puts them to work, moves them to high rise buildings, stuffs other families with them in small apartments, and makes them go to work in plants, day in day out, but they get free housing, free food (which is rationed out periodically), and free stuff, but then it gets pulled because the government can’t afford any more free stuff (phones, ipads, ect.). Take heed, this has happened, and it can happen again. Trump will get you back to a job you want and be proud of working because he’ll limit the regulations of businesses who hire workers who want to work, and not hire out to foreigners either. You deserve a job, you’ll get a job. Get off the freebie stuff because it’s not going to last you a lifetime.

Whereas, standard conditions are those conditions that are standard with every term of probation.\\nAn example of a standard term of probation is not to commit a new criminal offense.\\nAn example of a special term of probation is to complete a drug evaluation and treatment.\\nWhat is the legal standard to a probation violation?\\nIn order to violate probation, a probationer must willfully and substantially violate the terms of their probation.\\nIn other words, you can’t accidentally have a probation violation. Also, you can’t violate probation because of an inability to complete an item of probation (despite your best efforts). For example, it’s not a violation of probation to not pay restitution, EVEN WHERE IT IS ORDERED, so long as you don’t have the money to pay it. Consider a guy working full time to support a family and every penny he makes goes to the absolute bare essentials (food, shelter, rent). if that guy didn’t have any money left over to pay restitution costs, then a judge could not find there to be a willful and substantial violation. However, if the same guy had $300 left over every month and he spent it on lottery tickets, then he would have violated because he willfully gambled over paying his restitution.\\nThe state must only prove a probation violation by a preponderance of the evidence.\\nProbation Violation.

What can make him walk more than a mile? It's not a party with paper hats or a case of candy that makes him fat, THAT’S NOT WHAT HIPPOS DO! Nooooo. They, ooze through the gooze without any shoes, they wade through the water till' their lips turn blue, that’s what hippos do!\\nJust in case you were wondering what makes a hippo smile, right?\\nBefore you jump to the conclusion that I have lost my mind, let me explain. For some, the introductory lines of this blog will ring familiar. They are the lyrics to one of many songs that will echo through acres of forests, hillsides, and riverbanks during the months of June, July and August. These songs will be sung by a passionate army of young children who, along with their mentors and idols, will be participating in a ritual cherished by the inner child in so many of us--SLEEPAWAY CAMP!\\nIt’s February, which means families across the country are securing their spots at one of over 8,400 U.S. sleepaway camps and over 5,600 certified day camps. Have you reserved your spot yet? If not, let me explain why I think you should.\\nAs a parent of three and a former camper, camp counselor, and camp director, I cannot impress upon parents enough the meaningful impact summer camp can have on children. In my parent education classes, I often refer to sleepaway camp as the single most important and impactful experience a parent can provide their child. For most children, sleepaway camp develops the skills and mindsets parents so earnestly want to impart upon their children and does so in ways that we parents are sometimes unable to do. So why am I such a passionate advocate for sleepaway camp?\\nIt’s easy for a parent to forget that our number one responsibility is to prepare our children to LEAVE US. It’s counterintuitive, really. We spend so much of our lives connecting with these little beings that grow up so quickly. We offer them all we have. In them, we place our hopes, dreams, and aspirations. Only to have them roll their eyes when we perse our lips for a kiss as they leave the car and say, “Gross, mom. My friends will see. Ugh!” As our kids grow older they need us less. And they should. If you want to measure your success as a parent (and I don’t necessarily recommend that you do), consider how well you are preparing your children to leave you.\\nSleepaway camp is the single most important resource that I have found that helps prepare our children for healthy individuation. Individuation is a psychological term (coined by Carl Jung) that describes the process of self-actualization. In basic terms, a child’s individuation begins when he/she starts to see him/herself as separate from the parent. As much as we might not feel comfortable with the idea of our child separating more from us, it is an essential part of the process of a child becoming a healthy adult. At sleepaway camp, our children are given the opportunity to see themselves through a lens separate from their parents. The very nature of spending several days and nights without parents in a safe and controlled environment allows children to expand their view of themselves in relationship to the world around them. Their identities away from us are allowed space to grow.\\nOf all of the gifts sleepaway camp provides us parents, it’s personal responsibility and independence that are often the most gratifying. After years as a camp counselor and director, the response I most often heard from parents after their children returned from camp was appreciation that their child was helping out more around the house. Parents would comment that they didn’t have to ask their child to take their dishes to the sink, rinse them off, and put them in the dishwasher...it just happened! Parents were shocked to find their child had actually made their bed in the morning.\\nAt most sleepaway camps (and if this is NOT the case for your child’s camp, I would encourage you to find another one), personal responsibility is the cornerstone of daily life. Daily chore charts that require every camper to participate include jobs like: wait the tables in the dining hall, wash dishes, deliver mail, vacuum, collect and empty garbage, etc. At many camps, the kids are responsible for cleaning their own bathrooms. YES, even toilets. My favorite job to be assigned was “super spatula.” This job entails scraping all of the food off of the plates at mealtime onto one main plate and then transferring the “ORT” (or leftover food morsels) to the “ort bucket,” the contents of which would be fed to the pigs at the camp’s farm.\\nOur children can be forgiven for thinking that the world they live in is universal. After all, many of our children haven’t had the opportunity to see much of the world during their young years. Sleepaway camp, particularly those that attempt to attract children and staff from different cities, regions, and backgrounds, provide our children with new and unique experiences and the opportunity to navigate and negotiate social situations that involve people who are different from them and the friends they interact with every day. Often, many sleepaway camps will hire staff from one of several international staffing agencies, thus diversifying the experience even more. Camp program staff design clinics, courses, and experiences that are likely to be novel for the campers, thus expanding a camper’s view on what he/she might enjoy or be good at. I have had the good fortune of observing scores of campers find new hobbies, interest, and passions from just one experience at camp. I know campers who have become chefs from having participated in outdoor cooking classes or children who have become veterinarians as a result of attending horse/ranch camp.\\nWith peers: Ask any adult who has spent time as a camper or staff at a summer camp and they will most likely have close friends today that they met at camp, as well as an army of others that may not be as close, but whose sleepaway camp bond keeps them connected for a lifetime. Children learn not only how to build and maintain relationships with peers, but they also learn the VALUE of deep, supportive friendships. Especially as kids get older, I find that they appreciate having a world outside of school where friends “accept them for who they are.” At camp, children are able to let go of so much more of the pressures of “fitting in” and “measuring up” because they are in a new space. Not to mention, most sleepaway camps provide a technology-free environment for children to cultivate friendship the old-fashioned way--through conversation and shared experience--NOT through social media.\\nWith non-parent adults: In an age when the pressures and distractions our children face are only increasing, one of the best defenses against childhood and teen depression, anxiety, and self-harm is a supportive adult outside the family that your child knows they can turn to. In school settings we ensure that each child has at least one adult on campus they know they can talk to, and a camp experience widens the net of available confidantes for our children. As our kids individuate, their bonds with other adults become more important. They will value and look up to role models they trust, and those trusted adults become part of the village that helps raise our children. As a “retired” counselor, I can’t tell you how many now-grown campers still reach out to me for support, advice, or just a friendly and non-judgmental ear. It is a privilege for me to me held in that esteem, but also a helpful relationship for them as they navigate their way through young adulthood. I know the counselors whom I most respected held that role for me and my life is better for it.\\nWith YOU: Before you worry that sending your child off to meet and bond with other adults will diminish your own relationship, fear not. Consider that a child whose parents trust them enough to 1) send them to camp and 2) encourage them to seek mentorship outside the parental relationship feels valued and supported, and will actually respect you more for that freedom. I find that as children grow up, the parents with whom they feel closest are the ones who have learned to loosen the strings appropriately. We want the best for our kids, and helping them grow a network of close adults who can provide advice and support is one of the greatest gifts we can give them. Believe me, they will not forget about you – they will love you for the experience!\\nWhen I was a child, my friends and I were free to ride our bikes to the far ends of the earth (or at least that what it felt like) to discover our own adventures. We explored the outdoors with a lightness and whimsy that is often frowned upon today. Even though our neighborhoods are much safer than they have ever been, providing the freedom for children to explore the great outdoors feels too risky a venture for most parents. And even if we did provide that freedom, the draw of technology or the scheduling of numerous sports and activities has our children indoors and/or booked most of the time.\\nSleepaway camp is a ticket outdoors without the worry of putting children’s safety at risk.\\nYou don’t need me to remind you of the myriad of benefits being outdoors has on our health and wellbeing. There’s plenty of great research out there to tell you that being outdoors can do wonders to your body, mind, and spirit. However, maybe we all need to be reminded that our children need it, too. Desperately. And if you are like me and live in the middle of massive suburbia with all of its pressure, stress, noise, and competing interests, then we share an even greater need to get out in the great outdoors. Sleepaway camp provides this necessary connection to the natural world for our children.\\nBelow is a graphic published by the American Camp Association that highlights some of the benefits campers, parents, and staff experience from camp.\\nI imagine that all this sleepaway camp talk has got you wondering a few things. Let me take a stab at answering the most likely questions you may have.\\nI am also a big supporter of day camps. In fact my own children attend several day camps in our area and love them. There are so many great options with specific sports, music, art or hobby foci. There are also more globally focused camps that try to address the teaching of innovation, adventure, or making skills. Day camps are a gradual entre to sleepaway camp, too. All that said, there is some developmental growth and experience that only sleepaway camp can provide. In my book, including at least one week of sleepaway camp in the summer plans, along with a smattering of day camps and family time is a great recipe for summer growth and respite.\\nHow do I know my child is ready for sleepaway camp?\\nBegin with day camp experiences at least one year before signing up for sleepaway camp.\\nIf possible, select a sleepaway camp that is near to your home when your child is younger. For those in the Bay Area, there are many options in the Santa Cruz Mountains and surrounding areas.\\nA one-week session is usually the perfect starting point for a new sleepaway camper.\\nStart talking about sleepaway camp early. My children hear about my sleepaway camp experiences all the time. Last summer we visited my former sleepaway camp in preparation for one of my children to begin this summer. He has been talking about starting ever since we visited.\\nAttend a family camp at your favorite sleepaway facility. Most camps properties provide family camp options during the off season. These are great opportunities to acclimate your children to sleepaway camp.\\nWhat are indicators of quality?\\nI’m going likely disappoint a lot of people by not recommending any specific camp. It’s not my job to presuppose a family’s needs and values; I also don’t want to leave any quality program out of my recommendations. That said, there are some great resources out there to help you identify a great camp for your child.\\nFirst get recommendations from people you trust. There is no better indicator of quality than the recommendation of friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Second, you want to make sure that the camp you choose is accredited. Accreditation ensures that camps have the proper facility maintenance, staff training and support, safety plans and measures, and philosophical approach. The American Camp Association is the largest accreditation organizations in the U.S., but there are others. To ensure that the camp is a right fit, you can also read online reviews and take a visit. Camps welcome parent visitors to their facilities to discover more; take them up on that welcome.\\nSending your child to camp, especially the first time, with a friend is a great way to ease the anxiety that they--or more likely, you--have about being away from home for an extended period. Homesickness is real for many kids, even the most well adjusted and outgoing. Attending with a friend can help create just enough comfort, allowing kids, especially the younger ones, to adjust quickly to being away from home. Often, after the first experience with a friend, the childhood fears dissipate greatly. While attending with a friend is a great strategy, I do recommend providing at least occasional camp options that don’t always include the same group of kids your children hang out with at school or in sports/scouts/church, etc. Having an experience that challenges children to get out of their comfort zones is valuable; attending sleepaway camp with a team and coach they are always with is great, but there is growth in providing experiences with children and staff with whom a camper is unfamiliar.\\nWhat if I can’t afford camp?\\nMany camps offer financial aid and scholarships, as well as discounts. If you are interested in sending your child to sleepaway camp, but worry about the cost, contact the camp you’re interested in attending and ask about financial assistance. Another strategy for managing costs is to get your child excited about sleepaway camp and use earning money toward camp as an incentive or a substitute for expensive gifts at birthday and holiday times. Having a birthday party? Instead of receiving a dozen toys as gifts that will get broken and lost within two weeks, ask folks to donate to your child’s sleepaway camp fund. Many faith-based organizations and local community groups also sponsor summer camp experiences that are low or no cost. If you have the will to send your child to sleepaway camp, there are ways to make it happen.\\nAll this talk about camp makes me nostalgic for my camp days. Nature hikes, horseback rides, all-camp capture the flag, campouts under the stars, the sounds of a dozen hammers pounding leather, S’mores and camp songs by the campfire as fireflies light up the night sky. I’m not sure what can make a hippopotamus smile, but I am sure there’s nothing like belting the song out at the top of my lungs with new and lifelong friends.\\nIf my words have piqued your interest, you might want to sign your child up soon. Spots often fill up in January and February for the summer at most of the best sleepaway camps. Give your camp a call today and feel free to let me know how it goes once the summer wraps up.\\nWhat can make a hippopotamus smile? What can make him walk more than a mile?

Instagram is being used more for the Photo contest and social media campaigns these days. Even I have seen few images which I am sure it is not clicked by mobile camera, but they upload it by third-party applications uploading directly from the computer. Apart from that, you can even search in Instagram or know the stats of the users using the service.\\nHow can you use Instagram on your PC?\\nGramfeed: gives an interactive Instagram UI which helps you to manage your friends photos likes and check out familiar photos which are active. It also shows the maps which helps to know from where the photo is being clicked. It provides you grid view if you want to see the photos in one go or you can select it in normal view which helps you to check out the photos with time format.\\nInk361: is another Instagram third-party service, which helps you to give the full view of the photos uploaded by other users like you see in Instagram. Ink361 shows their ad in between of other images which irritates using the service sometimes as Instagram does not provide any ad placement on mobile service. The geo tagging feature is more useful than Gramfeed.\\nRelated Post: Learning from Red Bull Stratos – How to create Buzz!\\nInstagram for Chrome: this one is the best browser based application which gives the exact feel of using Instagram on the mobile. All the features are similar to the Instagram app on the mobile. But you can use this app in only Google Chrome browser.\\nLuxogram: This service is still in a beta phase. But will give all the needed features of Instagram. The photo feed gets updates as and when your friends add up the photos. When you move the cursor on the photo you will see the details of the photo and the update status.

You can create your own image and use it by specifying the -i flag to skeg create or skeg run. For now, your image needs to be based on skegio/base (like nate/aws), but that will change as skeg gets more sophisticated.\\nWhy does skeg run the container as a long running process and connect over SSH rather than only for the lifetime of a process?\\nDevelopment environments live longer than a single process, and they often involve many processes. Juggling these processes within an SSH session is a well understood problem with great solutions (like tmux), so for familiarity skeg takes the same approach.\\nAlso, there are many times where additional software needs to be installed and daemons run to try something out. A long running container is perfect for these situations.

But more recently, ordinary citizens are taking part as radiation levels have fallen at the plant site.\\nNineteen university students took a tour last November. The bus they rode took them past large tanks holding contaminated water as well as a massive piece of equipment attached to a reactor building to extract nuclear fuel. Throughout the visit, workers wearing protective clothing and face masks could be seen.\\nThe tour was organized by a group called AFW, which stands for Appreciate Fukushima Workers. Led by Akihiro Yoshikawa, 35, a former employee of Tokyo Electric Power Co., operator of the stricken plant, the group began escorting tours by residents living along the Pacific coast of Fukushima Prefecture from 2015. A major objective of the tours is to show residents what decommissioning involves.\\n“If ordinary citizens abandon interest, the plant site will be further shut off from the rest of the world,” Yoshikawa said.\\nHe said that 140 or so people had participated in the seven tours organized to date.\\nIwaki resident Kaori Suganami, 39, took part in a tour last June.\\nBecause of the core meltdowns at the No. 1 to No. 3 reactors, high levels of radiation continue to be emitted. This makes it very difficult to approach those three reactors.\\nElsewhere, though, rubble that was strewn throughout the plant grounds due to the tsunami generated by the magnitude-9.0 Great East Japan Earthquake has been removed, and radiation levels in many areas have dropped significantly. Ground surfaces have been paved and trees felled, which has also helped lower radiation levels.\\nAccording to TEPCO, about 900 people visited in the first year after the nuclear accident. Since then, the annual number of visitors has continued to increase. Local residents joining the tours also grew in number. About 3,700 people visited the plant in the first half of fiscal 2015. Of that number, about 250 were from Fukushima Prefecture.\\nUnlike workers at the plant site, visitors are not required to wear heavy protective gear. The basic getup is cotton gloves, disposable face masks and special footwear. Visitors are required to carry dosimeters. To reduce radiation exposure, visitors remain on the bus for large parts of the tour. Radiation exposure after an hour is in the range of 10 microsieverts, which is about 1 percent of the maximum additional radiation exposure of 1 millisievert established for the general population.\\nIn April 2014, TEPCO established a visitation center at the Fukushima plant and two to three groups consisting of individuals 18 or older are allowed in daily. But not just anyone is allowed on the tours. “An overall assessment is made after considering such factors as the objective of the visit,” said a TEPCO official.\\nThe decommissioning work is expected to take decades.\\n” FUKUSHIMA–Fukushima Prefecture’s population has declined by 5.7 percent since 2010, its largest recorded drop and the cause of a widening gender gap in some areas, according to national census figures announced on Dec. 25.\\nThe population drop is mainly due to ongoing evacuations following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, according to the preliminary figures released by the prefectural government.\\nThe prefecture lost 39,715 men and 75,743 women, a decrease of 4 percent and 7.3 percent from 2010, respectively. The difference is thought to have been caused partly by the majority male presence in reconstruction efforts.\\nThe national census figures are the first released by the prefectural government since the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, which triggered the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.\\nFukushima prefecture’s population as of Oct. 1 stood at 1,913,606, down 115,458, or 5.7 percent, from the last census in 2010.\\nAmong the six towns and villages where the entire population has left under evacuation orders, four towns recorded zero inhabitants: Okuma and Futaba, which co-host the nuclear plant, and nearby Tomioka and Namie.\\nThe village of Katsurao had 18 people who have returned to their homes after being evacuated. They are recorded as temporary residents, but the central government is working to make their resettlement permanent. Katsurao’s evacuation order is scheduled to be lifted next spring.\\nNaraha, where an evacuation order was lifted on Sept. 5, also experienced a massive decrease in its population, with 976 people living in the area, down 6,724 people, or 87.3 percent, from 2010. The figures illustrate the fact that few evacuees have opted to return home.\\nThe town of Hirono, where a large portion of the population is involved in nuclear reactor decommissioning work, tallied a male population of 2,746, up 2.3 percent from 2010. The female population, on the other hand, was about half that figure at 1,577, down 42.3 percent.\\nThe population figures are based on the number of people living in the prefecture as of Oct. 1, irrespective of whether they are registered as local citizens.\\n” Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that runs the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant, has opened a rest area and canteen for cleanup workers, more than four years after the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.\\nTokyo Electric has been widely criticized for its treatment of workers and handling of the cleanup, which is expected to take decades. A Reuters investigation in 2013 found widespread labor abuses, including workers who said their pay was skimmed and spoke of scant scrutiny of working conditions at the plant.\\n“We have taken various steps to cut accidents, including Tokyo Electric itself working more with contractors on the ground,” Akira Ono, Fukushima plant manager, told Reuters.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-20T00:18:20Z', 'url': 'https://japansafety.wordpress.com/tag/cleanup-workers/'}\n","{'text': 'Selling a property on Sunrise?\\nViewing highly recommended of this ground floor Southeast facing apartment.

It is one of the most popular hikes in the whole country. Not everyone experiences it the same way, however. Outdoor Life Norway is a guided service that offers guests a chance to see Pulpit Rock like most will never experience. The sunrise hike is an amazing way to up your chances of getting those stunning views without the crowds. If you truly want an original experience, though, go with their \"Off the beaten track\" tour. This hike begins with canoeing across a glacial lake to a long forgotten trail. Traverse the trail through multiple altitudinal zones and scramble up to the top of the fjord. There you can hike along until you reach your destination, a beautiful view of Preikestolen! There you can enjoy your view that majority of the hikers are missing. From there you will travel down to Pulpit Rock itself for some more photos. The trip down follows the more popular marked trail. If you are lucky enough, you may run into some of the Sherpas that have built the trails! If you\\'re looking for more tours to fill up time in Norway, Outdoor Life Norway offers many guided services year round.\\nThe land of fire and ice is an outdoor enthusiasts playground. Scuba diving in Silfra had been on my bucket list for years. It was a massive influence for me to get my PADI Open Water certification. Once I got my certification I remember my instructor asking me where I would go now that I could explore underwater paradises. I excitedly announced I\\'d be going to Iceland. He did not seem amused. \"Don\\'t you want to start somewhere... warmer?\" I brushed off his remark as quickly as I whisked off my hood and booties. I had my mind made up. Silfra was my white whale and I finally had it in my headlights. When everything was booked, I was struck with panic. For years I had dreamed of Silfra, a place where you could swim between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. Would it be as spectacular as I had made it out to be?? Oh yes it was. The crystal clear glacial water is nearly ice cold and is filtered through lava creating over 300ft of visability. This quality of water means you can sip it while you\\'re diving. It doesn\\'t get fresher than that. Being able to say i\\'ve touched both continental plates at the same time in the only place in the world where you can dive directly in continental plate cracks is certainly bragging rights. I thought that would be the highlight of my cold swim in Silfra, but once I was in the water I forgot about the location. The dive was beyone beautiful with such distinct geographical features. The colors were jaw dropping. Though the dive itself was short, it\\'s a dive that I could do over and over again. For those not scuba certified, many tour companies offer snorkeling excursions as well. Dive. Is. offers guests either option with photo services.\\nIf you asked a stranger what came to mind when they thought of Iceland, volcanoes would make the list. This is definitely merited. The land has practically been completely molded by volcanic eruptions. If there\\'s volcanoes you know there is lava, but Icelanders don\\'t let it get them down. In fact, it gets them going. These hardened lava fields create the perfect backdrop for some serious mountain biking. These trails are not for the faint of heart. I may have overestimated my skills since I had been mountain biking in the past. I rated myself as an intermediate, which I quickly second guessed as soon as I saw people pull out their own peddles from perfectly packed Camelbaks. As nonchalantly as I could muster, I asked what the tour company\\'s general client level was. My growing suspicion was confirmed. Most were season mountain bikers. I laughed in response to hide my surmounting fear. There was a good chance I may die in Iceland on a bicycle, I thought. There was worse ways to go I reasoned. It would make an interesting story, at least. Alas, I survived. Every part of my body may have hurt the next day, but something else was genuine as well. That was my smile. I signed up for a tour that I was not physically prepared for, but I did not regret it. It was a challenge that I overcame and I saw some stunning scenery along the way.\\nFor those of you like me who are not expert mountain bikers, there are more appropriate tours to take. Icebike offers guests several options for different levels of experience. After seeing my lack of finesse in the lava fields, Icebike offered to take me to another location afterwards. I battled with my opposing feelings. Should I stick it out and do another lava field or should I opt for something different? The guide was very patient and genuinely wanted me to enjoy the experience that was right for me. I went with their recommendation. A part of me felt like a quitter until I saw the change of scenery. The lava fields were wild and otherworldly. The new scenery was as lush as if I had been plopped into Neverland itself. My bitter feelings instantly faded. Biking through the purple lupine fields was a magical end to a demanding day. My lesson of the day: Don\\'t be afraid to try new things and have flexibility if they do not work out as perfectly as planned. My biking experience had more hiccups than I had predicted, but biking in Iceland was a once in a lifetime experience.\\nUtah snow is world famous. In a location with pristine snow and more resorts than one can choose from, how does one... well, choose?? I struggled with the dilemma during a recent visit. I was down to my last day and I had only seen two resorts. I wanted to end with a bang without draining my bank account on a lift ticket. I gave up and resorted to asking my local friend for direction. \"You need to go to Sundance\". Sundance? I was baffled. This resort had barely made my radar. While I had pondered the pyramid hierarchy of ski resort awesomeness for days, it took my friend no time at all to respond to me.\"Not Snowbird or Park City?\" I bantered. Nope, he was firm. Well that settled my predicament. At the very least it would bring me some mental clarity since I no longer had to wrestle the decision.\\nIf you go to Utah and don\\'t visit Sundance Resort, you are doing it wrong. I immediately felt at home at this resort, as if I had been snowboarding there since I learned the difference between regular and goofy. In a world obsessed with modernizing everything, Sundance has made a point of preserving that nostalgic ski culture that we all love and miss. Okay, so the staff is nice. Is that a good enough reason to opt for Sundance over a larger resort? In retrospect, Sundance is one of the smaller resorts, but the views are not. I almost fell off the chairlift gawking at the scenery. From the base to the peak, every corner of the resort offered views that even Ansel Adams would have to stop and photograph. The character didn\\'t stop at the lodge. The terrain kept me smiling from trail to trail. Feeling hungry? Stop at the peak for the most scenic nachos in the game. The Bearclaw Cabin is the only mountaintop lodge in Utah. If the sun is out, opt to sit outside in one of the zero gravity chairs. Sun and snow, can you beat it? If you want a resort with big hearts, big views, and a touch of home, you need to go to Sundance Resort.\\nThe sunshine state usually cultivates images of lazy beach towns with a weird abundance of shaggy-haired surfers with names like \"Zander\" or \"Brock\". If you don\\'t think of surfing, chances are you think of a retirement home paradise with every pm dinner special you could imagine. I am not here to knock your idea of Florida, because both scenes I just described exist in North Florida. I mean what\\'s wrong with eating your food truck burrito while your barefoot at a reasonable time so hard to get on board with? You have time for dessert and digestion before you catch those zzz\\'s! This is a battle meant for another day. If you aren\\'t into shredding the gnar or attending senior bingo, you may wonder what Florida has to offer other than concrete amusement parks. Rejoice my friends because I have a solution. Though it may not be topping your vacation brochures, Florida offers great places for paddle sports. These sports can be enjoyed by any age group. Are you a seasoned kayaker looking for a challenge? Opt to try paddle boarding instead for a great core workout that perfects your balancing skills. Are you more into the outdoors just to get a tan? Select a tandem kayak and make your buddy do the brunt of the work. I know this because I\\'ve been the recipient of this. As I paddled with all my might in Norway and wondered why we weren\\'t going faster, my friend Randy sat behind me happily snapping photos enjoying the fruits of my labor. I did not learn my lesson, however, since here I am recommending his devious plan to all of you. Just make sure your friend takes the front seat and doesn\\'t read this passage. You\\'re welcome.\\nThe Aloha state is paradise: sunny, laid-back, umbrella drinking mai-tai kind of paradise. Though many people come here to do nothing more than read their book on the island\\'s 30 miles of beaches, Maui can also be an adventure hot spot. I mean literally. The highest peak on the island is the world\\'s largest dormant volcano. The impressive Haleakala volcano never ceases to draw in outdoor enthusiasts from around the globe. Want to feel like Hawaiian royalty? Opt to catch a mesmerizing sunrise from it\\'s peak. Haleakala National Park offers guests more than just the star of the show. The park offers beach access but my favorite swimming spot of the entire Maui trip was dunking into the Seven Sacred Pools, or the Pools of \\'Ohe\\'o. If mermaids emerged from the depths, I would have thought it perfectly normal. I loved being able to climb up to a series of the falls and sit under the cool,flowing water as I looked out at the ocean. Some pools are more popular and accessible than others. As I mentioned, the pools flowed into the Pacific so that contrast in scenery was fantastic. Pack a picnic to make a great day of pool adventures. Swimming does not get more exotic than this. After you have your fill of swimming, continue hiking through Haleakala National Park to dry off. Your efforts will be rewarded when you reach a stunning bamboo forest. You may think you accidentally arrived on another continent with the landscape change.\\nHaleakala is not to be missed and you can access it off of the famous Road to Hana. The road itself merits a few days to explore. Opt for a convertible so you can soak up as much roadside scenery as you can. If you are still craving big views, end your trip with a cherry on top. A helicopter tour of Maui may not be the most physical tour you can do, but I promise you will be feeling the adrenaline. The tour gives you access to views you would never be able to see otherwise. Get close to peaks and waterfalls alike. The views are breathtaking and you may just get the feeling that you are about to be dropped off in Jurassic Park.\\nI can never be satisfied with doing everything just like everyone else. If I am going to a stereotypical tourist spot. I need to have an element that is different. While doing my research for antelope canyon, I found just what I was looking for to satisfy my stubborn self. Hidden Canyon Kayak was Arthur and the day trip through Antelope Canyon was my sword in the stone. At first I was a bit disappointed to see how large my group size was. In the past I have been spoiled with much smaller guide to tourist ratios in my travels. Once in the water, however, the problem dispersed as quickly as waves off my boat. The guides were good at accomodating people of all ability levels. As a frequent kayaker, I had a much faster pace than most. The guides recognized this, and made sure I did not feel restrained. Once we reached antelope canyon, we were released to explore the slot canyon on our own to a certain point. Again, I was happy to hear this since I much preferred being alone than attached to families I didn\\'t know. It was a thrill to be able to skip, run, and even sing if I wanted to down these beautiful corridors. I loved this tour and would recommend it to anyone. The guides were relatable and I enjoyed my time talking to them. My only recommendation is if you are an experienced kayaker, let the guides know ahead of time and they will bring you a touring kayak. Compared to my kayak at home, the kayak I was given made me feel like I was moving through mud. Avoid this and request a more efficient boat. They just don\\'t like to assign them to someone who is not experienced and has a higher chance to tip the narrow boats.\\nHave you ever thought that mountain biking is cool, but it would be so much cooler to bike on Mars? I can\\'t say i\\'ve been on this train of thought before, someone out there has been. To them I say, Mars is too far away. Sure you can keep fantasizing about the day that Richard Branson and Elon Musk unite like superheroes and create martian colonies complete with lotteries to fuel us basic humans with dreams of dual planet citizenship. Okay, maybe I have thought of this before. I digress. Biking in Page, Arizona may be the closest alternative. Really, the place is out of this world! So aren\\'t my puns. Accessible right from town, I was told by a local to check out the Rimview trail. I stopped at a local shop, Lake Powell Paddleboards, and rented a mountain bike. A quick overview of a map and a heeding message of \"there are parts of the trail that if you get hurt or can\\'t finish, no one can come get you\"and I was off. A little skeptical of my skill after my warning, I wasn\\'t sure how my day would go. Quickly into the trail, my reservations disappeared. It was easy to with the beautiful desert landscape. The \"rimview\" gets its name for a very specific reason. In parts you were on the very edge of the trail with a steep drop off. If it got too hairy, I simply walked. It was my best option since I was alone and if I got hurt, I didn\\'t want to think of the desolate potential situation. The views of Lake Powell were breathtaking. What blew me away was that I had the trail virtually to myself. In a busy tourist town, I came across only two people my whole time biking. The two people were locals at that. It was my escape from vacation. A step away to truly take in a place. This was not without hard work, however. The trail had its difficult moments and was best suited for at least intermediate riders. If you are new, you at least have the ability to walk any dangerous spots. The heat is also draining. A lot of water and snacks for energy are a must. I can honestly say my lunch was well earned this day.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-21T20:19:10Z', 'url': 'http://eatsandfeats.blogspot.com/p/feats.html'}\n","{'text': 'The latest in Jazz North East’s series of Schmazz gigs at the Jazz Café featured British guitarists Mike Walker and Stuart McCallum. All seats in the upstairs room were taken (two of the north east’s finest six-stringers bagged prime seats) and the stage resembled the guitar section of your local musical instrument store. The Greater Manchester-based duo settled down to play the first of two mainly acoustic sets in a setting Walker later described as having ‘a good vibe’.\\nThe material consisted of original compositions (a Schmazz prerequisite) and one or two standards. The opening number had an Americana feel to it, so it came as no surprise to learn it was Bill Frisell’s Where Do We Go? Walker, a man with an impressive cv – the big bands of Mike Gibbs and Kenny Wheeler, stints with Julian Arguelles and Nikki Iles, to his latest Anglo American project, the Impossible Gentlemen – shuffled a set list at will, suggesting to McCallum they do ‘Orpheus’. A change of guitar, some retuning, a bit of banter and into Luiz Bonfá’s Black Orpheus. This and the following number – All the Things You Are – exemplified Stuart McCallum’s penchant for reharmonizing tunes. Dark tones, dense improvisations, Walker picking up on McCallum’s initial foray, further solo invention, the seamless dovetailing of ideas.\\nA Walker composition – Wallenda’s Last Stand – inspired by the life story of a high wire walker’s final, fatal, do or die journey and McCallum’s The French Song illustrated their talents as tunesmiths. The second set heard McCallum’s Beholden and Walker’s Clock Maker. Walker introduced the latter number with a hilarious, true tale of his friend saxophonist Iain Dixon’s father’s clock making obsession. Imagine a house full of clocks – He made one every four minutes, said Walker – all primed to chime on the hour. It was Walker’s mission in life when visiting Dixon Snr to leave before the cacophonous clock chorus struck up! A distinct folk strand ran through the second set, notably McCallum’s tune inspired by a visit to the Shetlands and his authentic folk ballad Seasons. The one time student of Walker has gone on to work in a variety of contexts including a plum job with John Surman, tenure with the hip Cinematic Orchestra and work with Tim Garland’s Northern Underground Orchestra (including an appearance at the Durham Miners’ Gala a few years ago). This Schmazz gig was one for students of the guitar rather than one for the jazz guitar purist.\\nEarlier, pianist Paul Taylor played a solo set in the downstairs bar. The Tyneside-based Taylor developed ideas from an impressionist palette, quietly applying complementary hues to an uncluttered canvas. The audience listened intently, some seemingly holding a breath, such was the silence during a half hour improvisation.\\nNext month’s Schmazz concert at the Jazz Café departs from the usual last Tuesday in the month date.

Here\\'s a HUGE CONGRATS to Amber on the launch of her new website, and for turning her dream into a reality.\\n\"My entire life has transformed as a result of the choice to pursue my dream and make the leap to launch my business.\"\\nAmber\\'s story of courage and passion will inspire and encourage you in your own journey!\\nAmber: I have always been fascinated with human behavior, psychology and really understanding why people do what they do. I have been equally obsessed with helping people breakthrough their fears and roadblocks to live a more fulfilling and joyful life. I grew up witnessing the people I love struggle and made it my goal early on to create a different way of life for myself so I could make a positive impact on the lives of others by showing them what I learned. What better way to take ownership of your life than to match your work with the sacred mission?\\nAmber: I worked in collegiate athletics marketing for a decade and had the gift of contributing to the growth of a Division I athletics brand on a national scale. My career path there was incredibly entrepreneurial and I taught myself how to write sales copy, design websites and graphics and basically everything in between. I was also asked to teach at the university and mentor students throughout my career, both of these roles allowed me to hone and develop my craft as a coach.\\nAmber: The answers do not live out there, they come from within. I\\'ve spent thousands of dollars on coaches and programs and live events only to be guided on back to my own truth. I do not regret one penny spent or mile walked on this path, though, as it has helped me to become even better at what I do and more committed to the bigger mission of my life.\\nAmber: The funny thing about this question is that so many people DID tell me that \"Everything I need is already within me.\" But, I didn\\'t listen because I had to go on my own quest to find my way home to myself. I am so grateful for all of the people who patiently and lovingly stood by me on this journey, I am certain I will need them to continue to remind me of this message, once again, down the path.\\nGO LIVE: WHAT WAS THE MOMENT YOU HAD WHEN YOU SAID \"I SHOULD DO THIS\" OR WHAT MADE YOU TAKE THE LEAP INTO WORKING FOR YOURSELF?\\nAmber: I had known that I wanted to be a work from home mama well before I was pregnant, only I didn\\'t know HOW it was going to happen. After my own near-death experience (aka wakeup call) during our daughter\\'s birth, I knew that it was time to get serious about making this dream come true. I launched my business 8 months after she was born and quit my job with just one client on the books (crazy!?), but I knew that if I could welcome in one client, more would come and focusing my time/energy on my business was the only way to help it grow. Four years later, I am so grateful for that courageous former version of me.\\nGO LIVE: WHAT THINGS HAVE YOU GAINED, OR DO YOU HOPE TO GAIN, IN YOUR LIFE FROM FOLLOWING THIS DREAM?\\nAmber: I have my life, my health, my husband (we retired him from his police career in 2017), the memories with our daughter that I haven\\'t had to miss a minute of, sacred friendships with people I would have never met, time with the people I love the most and a deep sense of fulfillment and personal growth that comes with it. My entire life has transformed as a result of the choice to pursue my dream and make the leap to launch my business.\\nAmber: I absolutely love your design work and the way you approach supporting visionaries like me in sharing our message and mission with the world. I so appreciate how you tend to the finite details while honoring the big vision and delivering a finished product that will make a massive impact. Our websites create a powerful experience for our future clients to feel fully witnessed as they take the next step on their journey. I am so thrilled with what we\\'ve created together.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-23T06:12:48Z', 'url': 'https://www.golivehq.co/blog/amber-lilyestrom-is-live-on-squarespace'}\n","{'text': 'As her favourite colour is purple I knew I had to use that colour. A month or so ago I found some purple sugar and white sugar pearls. I wanted to do a kid cake that was elegant given her age. That was as far as I got until the morning of the day everyone was coming. Talk about a decorating block! I just couldn’t think of anything. Fortunately on the walk with the dogs I got an idea. And it had to be done quickly as I had an hour to do this. Yikes!\\nNot only does she like purple, she likes butterflies so I decided to go with that. I whipped up some buttercream icing like I did for these cupcakes. Before I added the purple I scooped some white into a decorating bag.\\nCarefully place the top layer on and brush any loose crumbs off.\\nIce the whole cake smoothing as best you can. Isn’t this a great purple?\\nNext I used the white frosting to outline the flowers and butterfly. Finally I got the consistency right and it flowed like it should. In the past I was squeezing with all my might. Too much work. I used the white pearls for the centers and the purple sugar for the petals and wings. I really need to problem solve getting the sugar where I want it to go. There was a bit of colouring outside the lines with this bit.\\nTo finish it off I added some icing dots on the sides.\\nThis entry was posted in Desserts and tagged apples, baking, buttercream icing, chocolate cake. Bookmark the permalink.\\nWow! that’s one heck of a cake:) It’s beautiful!! I love the butterfly:) She’s going to LOVE IT! Happy Birthday to your daughter….\\nI can’t wait for those pics…I just love everything about your daughters cake! It came out beautifully!!!!!!\\nThank you. 🙂 His birthday is in June so I have time to plan!\\ncan’t wait! Have a Great weekend:) and as always thanks for sharing….\\nThanks, I’ll let her know.\\nHappy Birthday to your daughter. That’s certainly a cake and a half. She must have be thrilled.\\nShe liked it. 🙂 They appreciate the effort for stuff like this which is really nice.\\nSo fun!! A few years ago, my twin sister put together a cookbook of all the recipes from our childhood years; we celebrated our birthday last week, and I made our whole birthday dinner from that cookbook! It’s amazing how memories if food stay with us– I’m sure your daughter will never forget this cake!\\nWhat a wonderful idea! Very special.\\nWhat a sweet cake…love the flowers and butterfly as I’m sure she did as well.\\nDaughters are so~ precious. Happy Birthday to your 12 year old… I love purple too and she will love it! Fae.\\nWhat a fabulous looking cake! Yes, my favourite colours are deep crimson and purple. Having said that, at your daughters age I had my bedroom painted purple walls and white accents…put me right off purple for a while!\\nHer room at her mother’s house has purple walls so we’ll see how long this lasts. At our house she still has the yellow as the main colour that her dad did years ago. I like the idea of purple with the white accents though. A great contrast.\\nWell happy birthday! Wow! Now that’s purple! I bet she was pleased. Good for her.\\nHappy Birthday to your daughter. A cake to remember always.\\nLove that quote! They grow so fast.\\nWow Virginia the cake is beautiful!

Why not let InDevR’s team of scientists do it for you?\\nThe single radial immunodiffusion assay is used to quantify the concentration of antigen in a given sample relative to a standard of the same antigen. In short, an agarose gel is infused with reference antisera and holes are punched in the gel. Antigen is placed in the holes and diffuses into the agarose. The distance that the antigen diffuses into the agarose is measured as a precipitate “ring” in the gel after staining. The ring diameter is proportional to the quantity of the antigen present in a given well.\\nThe SRID assay is applied across the influenza vaccine industry. It is widely used to determine the potency of the hemagglutinin content of vaccines prior to release of the product.\\nInDevR has scientists trained and experienced in performing the SRID assay to specifications put forward by the FDA.

The girls in Moms to Moms meet the first and second Wednesday nights of the month, a sort of round-table, open forum where no topic is off limits, but mostly parenting and reassuring that they\\'re going to make it.

Truly.\\nMy thankful journal is simply a little leather-bound book where I record the gifts God has given me. Eucharisto. Thanks. One Thousand Gifts. 10,000 reasons. Why write them down? Because I dare not forget the goodness of God.

SEF Canada’s managing director Suzette McFaul discusses the project’s community-driven approach to developing more sustainable practices in artisanal gold mining.\\nMiners in the Clean Gold project are transitioning from mercury to cyanide-based processing methods.

Image courtesy of SEF Canada.\\nArtisanal miners often struggle with the brutal economics of small-scale production and accessing markets. Image courtesy of SEF Canada.\\nMcFaul with a worker on-site in Ecuador.\\nOn 16 August, the Minamata Convention on Mercury entered into force, marking the culmination of a years-long effort to come up with an international response to the shared threat of mercury exposure.\\nWhile mercury has been used in industrial processes for hundreds of years, its extreme toxicity poses massive public health risks. Mercury poisoning can cause irreparable brain damage and organ failure, and low-level exposure is a significant cause of premature deaths.\\nThe Minamata Convention, named after the Japanese city that has been living for decades with the consequences of a mass mercury poisoning, brings with it tighter controls for the handling of mercury in industry, as well as provisions for what it calls the “phase-out and phase-down of mercury use in products and processes”.\\nIt also means renewed scrutiny on the use of mercury in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in many countries, and artisanal gold mining in particular. Mercury is used extensively in ASM operations, and often in highly unsafe domestic conditions, to process ore and recover gold.\\nBut for small-scale miners working with simple tools and lacking the deep pockets, greater pressure to stop using mercury hasn’t changed the economic fundamentals of their trade. Technical limitations mean that recovery rates are low and the grey market buyers of their gold, often jewellers, offering far below spot value. “And that’s if they don’t get mugged on the way in a cash-based society,” says McFaul.\\nAfter being invited to southern Ecuador’s El Oro province in 2014 to see how SEF’s economic development model might help artisanal mining communities, McFaul established Clean Gold Community Solutions (Clean Gold) to take a more holistic approach to improving ASM standards in the region.\\nThe company has partnered with artisanal miners, along with a technical ‘dream team’ led by the University of British Columbia, to make the transition away from mercury processing, while also taking on the upgrade of a local gold processing plant to refine the miners’ products and instilling business development skills to empower the miners as business owners.\\nThe plant, which McFaul says should be up and running “around next week”, will switch out mercury for cyanide in the recovery process, as the latter breaks down much more quickly if released. But the partnership, McFaul stresses, is about more than just replacing a harmful industrial element; it’s about building new, sustainable systems centred around the plant.\\nIn turn, transparency around processing methods and environmental performance facilitates access to markets that will offer close to spot prices for the miners’ gold, rather than the 40-60% of spot price that McFaul says they get from grey market buyers.\\nAt the heart of Clean Gold’s model is prioritising the economic and social health of the whole community that surrounds ASM operations. This starts with only partnering with miners who have invited the company to do so, and developing the local economy is part of the deal.\\n“The community has to buy in and the community has to win,” says McFaul. “There’s a community foundation that comes out of every Clean Gold project. “The community has to agree, and the miners agree, that part of that community foundation will go into an SEF model to help all the other people in the community.\\nThe approach aims to be the polar opposite of the exploitative, opaque relationships that can characterise mining communities’ interactions with large-scale mining companies. Putting the reins in the hands of the community helps create a virtuous cycle that is key to the wider economic development plan, even if a hands-off approach presents its own challenges.\\nClean Gold is keen to expand its methods to ASM communities around the world. Plans are already in place to set up another project in Ecuador next year, and McFaul is hoping that the current plant upgrade and community development scheme will be a strong showcase to help sell the concept to prospective future investors.\\nIf the money can be found, there is apparently no shortage of demand for the Clean Gold model. The company has already visited Guyana, and McFaul says invitations have been extended from neighbouring Colombia, as well as Kenya and Mali.\\nCertainly there are challenges still to come. If the model is to be a true success on its own terms, it will be vital that miners and local families are as happy with the profit-sharing arrangement as the investors. But if the project in El Oro Province can make its environmental, ethical and business case, it could set a progressive template for cleaning up artisanal gold mining while also encouraging sustainable growth in communities that often live well below the poverty line.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-24T02:33:37Z', 'url': 'https://www.mining-technology.com/features/clean-gold-making-artisanal-mining-work/'}\n","{'text': \"At “AT DESIGN GROUP” your privacy is our priority.

I’ll have something to say about the remake later and why it definitely doesn’t work in comparison to its predecessor, but I truly love the original film. In fact, I love it so much to admit that it’s just my favorite scary film—it’s one of my all-time favorite movies.\\n“The Haunting” is a superb, gorgeously-shot, very well thought-out chiller that uses psychological tension and character development in the same concepts of mystery and atmosphere. It takes place in a haunted house—Hill House, to be exact—and it’s about a group of characters who would like to investigate the supernatural occurrences of such a place but get much more than they expected. That premise sounds pretty simple, but Wise’s direction, along with great cinematography as well as great acting, makes it far more than what it could have been. Even if you don’t really find it very scary (it depends on whether or not you accept the “less is more” aspect—I’ll explain later in this review), it’s still a gripping psychological thriller, Gothic story, and character study.\\n“The Haunting” begins with an opening narration over a shot of an ominous-looking mansion in the night, and right away, the narration sets up the premise in a most interesting way. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a depiction of a haunted house, or rather just exploring a haunted house, has ever been put in a better way. “An evil old house, the kind some people call haunted, is like an undiscovered country waiting to be explored. Hill House has stood for 90 years and might stand for 90 more. Silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there…walked alone.” And when the intellectual voice of Richard Johnson puts it like that, I think I might follow him as well as those his character, Dr. John Markway, are brought into his experiment. And yes, his experiment is simply to investigate any sort of paranormal activity while spending several nights in Hill House. The house is full of history that connects to further evidence that it may be haunted, which fascinates him even more. He wants to know if everything he’s heard and studied is as real as it may seem.\\nBrought in on the project are Eleanor “Nell” Lance (Julie Harris), clairvoyant Theodora “Theo” (Claire Bloom), and the house’s cynical new heir, Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn). Eleanor, in particular, is our main focus of the film, as we hear her inner thoughts a good amount of time and has the most compelling character arc of the group. She’s a meek, insecure, guilt-ridden woman who has spent most of her adult life caring for her sick mother until her death, leading to further severe guilt that she has to deal with everyday. She seeks to belong somewhere with somebody, which is why she does take a chance and leaves her sister’s apartment (where she sleeps on the couch), and steals her sister’s car to make her way to Hill House, where she is finally expected somewhere.\\nHill House itself is a marvel to look at. It’s a large, maze-like mansion that looks like a Gothic castle, with many secrets and unsettling decorations and such. Among the most notable unsettling locations in the house is the library, which features a tall, spiraling staircase that is very rickety and unsafe. The exteriors and interiors of Hill House are just extraordinary and the whole place gives off a creepy vibe. You definitely can tell that something is not quite right with this place. Eleanor notices this upon first arriving, thinking to herself that “it’s looking at me” and if she goes into this house, she’s afraid she won’t come out the same way. But she does come inside, get to know Markway, Theo, and Luke, and surely enough, many strange things occur with apparent supernatural forces at work here.\\nBut how much of the supernatural is actually “supernatural?” We spend so much time with Eleanor and we know that she isn’t quite mentally-stable because of her insecurities that sometimes take her over, so you have to wonder just how much of this ghost-story is actual ghosts and how much of it is actually in Eleanor’s mind. It’s evident that ghosts are real in these surroundings, as Eleanor is not the only one to experience these happenings. But what about when she explores the house herself and feels herself to be more at home, in a way depicted creepier than it sounds? Is she being controlled by the paranormal forces, is she letting in to her hopes of belonging somewhere, are her insecurities getting the very best of her? I won’t go into too much detail about what I get out of the connection between her and Hill House, but trust me when I say it’s an excellent psychological study. And that this is a character who seeks redemption and acceptance within a haunted house makes it even more unnerving.\\nIt’s hard to pick my favorite “scary moment,” as most people choose their own favorite scary moments from their favorite horror films (the opening in “Halloween,” the exorcism in “The Exorcist,” the shower scene in “Psycho,” and so on). There are literally more than I could think of right off the bat, and oddly enough, every time I watch the movie again, I find myself unnerved throughout the whole movie because of those many moments. To name some of these scenes, I’d start with the introduction in which we see in flashback (with help of Dr. Markway’s narration) the past historic happenings of Hill House (suicide, accidents, etc.)—it’s a great opening and also very well-crafted in how it’s able to set up the environment and build up suspense for the rest of the story, and of course quite unnerving. There’s the first occurrence on the characters’ first night in Hill House, as Eleanor and Theo are frightened by loud, pounding noises coming from outside their bedroom and hold onto one another in fear—the terror is genuine and the scares come as unexpected so that the characters’ fear becomes ours, because we know just about as much as they do. Most memorably, arguably, is the scene in which Eleanor awakens at night to hear what sounds like a child being beaten and crying in pain. She wants to yell but is too afraid to, and she holds hands with Theo who is obviously as frightened as she is because, as we hear through Eleanor’s inner thoughts, she is holding on to her hand a little too tightly. When she finally yells “STOP IT!” and the lights turn on, she looks to see that…nobody was holding her hand the whole time. This is a perfect “scary moment”—the buildup, the tension, and the payoff are all very well-handled, making the standard-but-needed question “Whose hand was I holding” seem all the more impactful. There are many more moments like that in this movie. And do I even need to mention that the aforementioned “tall, spiraling staircase” comes into place for a crucial moment later?\\nThe casting of the four principal roles is spot-on. Julie Harris is excellent as Eleanor, creating a believable portrait of an odd, meek woman who is possibly misguided to find a place to feel accepted. It’s a great performance and it makes “The Haunting” more of a character study than a haunted-house story. Richard Johnson is also great as Dr. Markway, a man who could convince you to jump off a cliff if he found a solid reasoning behind it. I love the way he puts the supernatural occurrences most of us have heard of, particularly the difference between “ghosts” and “ghouls.” Claire Bloom makes Theo her own character and also gives a certain indication that she might actually be a lesbian, which could explain why she acts the way she does toward Eleanor (compassion mixed with teasing most of the time) and also would give another disturbing sense in the scenes when they’re the only ones in a room together. Bloom makes risky decisions with this role, but they’re never over-the-top and are played effectively. I even enjoyed Russ Tamblyn’s comic relief—as Luke, Tamblyn plays a man who doesn’t believe in the supernatural or the phenomena; he’s just protecting his investment after being left the house and simply enjoys poking fun at whatever experience or little detail that the other characters bring up. He’s a smooth, wisecracking guy who likes to drink and crack jokes (“This ghost I can expect in my room tonight—is it male or female?”), which makes his ultimate belief in what’s really happening here all the more effective because all this time, he has served as a representation for some of the more cynical audience members. When he finally seems as scared as everyone else, it’s believable.\\nThe filmmaking serves as another reason “The Haunting” works as well as it does. A good number of shots in this movie looks like it’s been fully prepared for first, so that we feel a hint of unease and also fascination. Even the reaction shots, which are mostly thankless, say something about the consistency—some of them are even at low angles with characters on either the right or left side of the screen. With a location as grand as Hill House, it’s important to know how to frame certain shots and Robert Wise obviously went out of his way to create something unique.\\n“The Haunting” is undoubtedly my favorite horror film. Its scares are more than effective because of how much its psychological terror works well. The themes are very well-presented. The depictions of the “haunted” aspects of this house and the occurrences are fascinating to listen to. The lead character of Eleanor is a great character for this sort of story. And it fascinates me and of course continues to scare me every time I watch it. It’s a well-crafted, excellent chiller.\\nNOTE: I mentioned the brilliant opening lines earlier in this review. I should also add that the similar-sounding ending lines are even more chilling, particularly because of who says them.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-24T10:34:17Z', 'url': 'https://smithsverdict.com/2013/07/29/the-haunting-1963/'}\n","{'text': \"Hey there!

He has an ensemble that has released three albums, Home Piano Book (Volume One), Ensemble, and Leaf. He was previously an ambient electronic musician as Waves on Canvas. While not touring Stefano produces soundtracks and sound design for film, documentaries and video games.\\nInnerversitysound: Stefano, a bit of background first. You had a recent earlier electronic outfit called Waves on Canvas that produced electronic music that was received well enough given the scene. But nothing in comparison to the reception that your three albums with your ensemble. Can you tell us a bit about the departure from electronic music to a form of modern classical ensemble? What was the impetus for you for this break?\\nStefano: Basically I had a graduation in electronic music from the conservatory in my town. I was very into electronic music and I had studied it a lot. But also from childhood I had a background in classical music because I studied organ, or an instrument with a keyboard. Then I made this Waves on Canvas project and it was very great for me and also it was a way of mine to give a rendition, or a proper tribute to what I was into when I was younger, especially 4AD stuff in the Ivo (Watts-Russell) era. But in regarding electronic music I’ve got this mixed feeling. Especially nowadays when everyone can buy a computer, a laptop and record some seagulls or birds with their smartphone and then download a version of Ableton Live, add some effects, some tweaks and then claim himself an electronic musician or a drone music musician.\\nOne of the reasons for the change was I wanted to take a distance from all of this because now a lot of people, a lot really, are making electronic music. If you take an example of the 90’s when buying music gear was really expensive and it wasn’t something that was ready at hand for everyone, which wasn’t a good thing anyway, because in my opinion everyone should have the opportunity to say something musically. It was different, now everyone is making electronic music and to my personal subjective perception most of them sound the same. Because they are done with the same environment, the same software, a laptop and so forth. This was one of the reasons but I also just wanted to get back to simple things and try to say something musically, just for me. Interested in just a few things, natural acoustic sounds for instance, and I wanted to get back to my roots, because when I was younger I was just playing an instrument as well. So this is something that really made me decide to be just me, myself, and just work with simple natural sounds. From time to time I had some electronicia, some simple sine waves and simple elements, like little noises, but these are just things that in electronic music are considered a simple thing, a sine wave. These are things you can also find in the works of Stockhausen or Xenakis, basically in the pioneers of electronic music. So we are not talking about synthesisers or computers but more about tapes. So I just decided to change and I’m ok with this decision really.\\nInnerversitysound:In interviews you have mentioned a wide range of influences from industrial, indie pop, German electronic music, drum and bass, ambient, and the ethereal electronic pop of your teenage years. The early band of yours Antennah, what was the ideas that drove you and your friend Valentinno Murru?\\nStefano: When I was a child I was playing the organ and when I was a teenager I discovered New Wave bands, Joy Division and that kind of stuff from about 1986. So my decision was to buy a bass, I was a bass player and we just formed this band. We just wanted to make something new, quite naïve. It was great but after about five years I just wanted to make something else and this electronic music thing in me started when I was very young I had this computer in my house and I started programming this computer to make simple sounds and to play by pressing the keys of the keyboard while I was playing the organ. So I was tweaking a home computer to make some sounds and noises and this was my very first approach to electronic music. So after I was in a band for five years, playing the bass, I felt a real need, an urgency to widen my palette of sounds so I decided to leave them and start making electronic music. From 1992 until 2006 I was making electronic music.\\nThe last thing I did, apart from the Waves on Canvas project was a collection of remixes for Kirsten Hersch, the singer for Throwing Muses, because in a period around 2006-7 she was recording the tracks of her new album and releasing the tracks of the songs on the web. So I was just taking the vocal parts and doing the rest, a brand new arrangement with new chords, new tonal centre. Just then I was just starting to think differently about electronic music. So this is just my background, I was taught classical music, I played bass in a band but in the meantime I was still tweaking my computer at home, I embraced electronic music, but now it is like being back home again. Just being what I was when I started making music when I was a child.\\nInnerversitysound: So the immediate reception of At Home Piano Book (Volume One) on Home Normal was decisive in its endorsement of your new approach to music. Can you tell us a bit about this album and how the collaboration with Ian Hawgood came about?\\nStefano: Basically I started making these little compositions on the piano, they were just little ideas. I sat at the piano when I had ideas and if I felt they were interesting I just recorded the scratch idea on the iPad. So then I started to compose them properly with a kind of structure and my idea was to make a collection of piano impressions, like little water colours, something like that. Nothing too serious. I sent a few of those tracks to Ian, about 5 years back and he was really into those tracks. Then we started emailing and I felt quite lucky, because when you have a label like Home Normal, which is kind of busy, there are a lot of people sending stuff, I felt lucky anyway. And then we became friends. Of course there is a mutual friendship now between the artist and the label as well. I wanted to keep that feeling of playing in a room, a very simple thing.\\nInnerversitysound: You are incorporating minimal electronic touches and processing. Has it receded so far into the background that it may eventually disappear? Or has the impression of the knowledge gained by exposure to these forms indelibly informed your composition of classic forms?\\nStefano: There is a future release that will be out in September that is based on a work of a friend of mine who makes paintings and cartoons as well. He was living in Japan for about 9 years, he worked with Sakamoto, designed a Swatch and he made this last book about his memories in Japan. I was really inspired by his latest work because I love Japanese culture as well and then I wrote and produced this new album called Japanese Notebooks. It features some electronicia, but very subtle, there is also some in Leaf. It is just a little colour and nothing that characterises too much the overall sound. What I still like about elements that come from electronic are the sub-basses and that round warm feeling. And that is just from a simple sine wave, a regular oscillation of a wave. Yes there is still electronic music but very few and just in a very delicate measure. I am planning to use some electronic elements like arpeggios of simple waves to be a part of an arrangement in the future. I am thinking about this idea but mostly it is just acoustic music. I don’t want to be a second hand Max Richter or things like that because mostly I am still exploring and looking for a language of mine of course for otherwise it would not be very useful to be out there and be a clone of someone.\\nInnerversitysound: You formed an ensemble which is a change from the solitary electronic musician. It involves a good deal more interpersonal communication. How did forming this ensemble come about and can you tell us a bit about the dynamics of working with 3 other people in an ensemble has changed your practice?\\nStefano: If you make electronic music for instance, you have a very immediate response to what you are doing because you are just playing sounds with a machine. You have got those sounds, just suddenly. When you score, when you write music on a score, yes you can make sounds to make a sort of pre-production of what you have in mind. But then again when you play with real players it will sound different again. So it’s really exciting and interesting because a player is not a machine and he will play differently every time and it will depend on how tired he is from his feeling of the day; a lot of variations can happen and anyway real instruments forever change. Yes the real feeling is in the score but the overall feeling of the track can change of course. This is something that fascinates me a lot because we are humans, we are faulty humans by nature so it’s great to transpose this aspect into music. We are not talking about recorded music that will sound the same every time you play it to your friends but music that will change every time and it’s great. I love this, I really need this aspect from music to be alive, in a way.\\nInnerversitysound: In Quiet Fracture on the Leaf album is the most sound designed piece of the recent few albums. Is this interlude kind of thing going to happen more often or was it something that just occurred in the making of the album.\\nStefano: Yes, Leaf, it’s an album of that started when my father started being ill. And my father now has a very serious illness. And this illness was showing by some very strange events like from time to time he was falling but we underestimated what was happening. Quiet Fracture is about something that is very slowly starts to go, in this case it was my father, and then shows in itself completely. So there are some steps and some laughter from a few women. This is quite symbolistic about something that starts to show inside and then grows as a big laughter. Yes that album it is written, ‘from my father, to my father’ and it was a very bad time and for some reasons it still is. It’s quite personal to be honest.\\nInnerversitysound: In reading background material about what you do I stopped at you commenting that you had adopted a very simple attitude towards life and music generally. If you could elaborate on this turn to simplicity and its effects on the whole of what you do in life.\\nStefano: Simplicity, simple things, it is a value that I make mine a lot. For instance my decision to move on from electronic music to apparently more simple music. Like the title Leaf, it is just a small green element that we see on the side of the road, in the trees, but if you move your attention to the inner structure of the leaf, in this structure you see a lot of little path roads and this is a clear symptom that simplicity shows us a different world if you take the right pathways and if you approach simplicity with the right attitude. I have been doing Zen meditation for about 10 years in my life so I am really attached to a simple approach to life which is not a basic approach. It is just simple because then by embracing simplicity you can embrace the complexity of life as well. So it is something very connected. Like for instance when I was making electronic music I had complexity at hand very easy because of sounds, because of all those electronic elaborations on sounds as well. But to me it wasn’t that interesting anymore. But if you use just simple sounds and you give them the proper attention to the inner structure of a simple acoustic sound, it has a lot of things that change every time. Like if you struck a note on the piano and every time it will resonate differently and this is apparently a simple sound which it definitely is not. This is an example of simplicity not being simple at all. Simplicity being a great and a good example of the complexity of life itself. Because simple things to me are just the first side of the real complexity of life.\\nInnerversitysound: Your album Japanese Notebooks is slated for later this year. Is it completed yet, or is it still in production or in Ian Hawgood’s very long cue for mastering?\\nStefano: The album is just finished, mixed and mastered. I finished it in January and I am leaving it to ‘take the dust’ for 4 to 5 months and then I will listen to it again to fix a few things with fresh ears and a fresh mind because you have to take the distance from things at a certain point. Possibly, I don’t know yet, I will ask someone to master it. I still have to decide. I usually master things myself, I am very much of a DIY person, and I really love this attitude. I do almost everything about my job; like promoting, producing, I have my own label as well, Stella Recordings, for my stuff, so it’s really important for me to have most of the things under my control. I rarely work with people, one of these ones is Ian because I really trust him, we are friends, but I really trust Ian and his approach to music. So this album is basically finished, I just have to fix a few things here and there. But that’s it really.\\nInnerversitysound: In terms of ambitions, or strategies when this simplicity gets a bit tricky and demanding. Have you an escape plan lined up?\\nStefano: My escape plan is that I will always have to be honest with myself and correct about what I am doing at the moment. And when all of this won’t work anymore I will ask myself what is happening and if I won’t have any reply for myself, I always tell myself and to my future wife as well, maybe I will stop making music as well. I hate the idea of riding the wave of what is going on at the moment because I wouldn’t be honest to myself and mostly I would be wasting my time. Because it is not written anywhere in the sky that I have to make music. Maybe there will be a time when I just have to stop, or maybe not. I don’ know. But what I know is that my only escape is just to be honest with myself and ask myself directly what’s happening and add a proper reply, never be negative or positive. I hope positive.\\nLeaf is out now on Stella Recordings and digitally on Home Normal.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-21T10:30:46Z', 'url': 'https://www.cyclicdefrost.com/2016/04/stefano-guzzetti-by-embracing-simplicity-you-can-embrace-the-complexity-of-life-interview-by-innerversity-sound/'}\n","{'text': 'Applications for the 2019 Fellowship are now closed.

It’s such an honor to be able to help people grow in their personal leadership skills and pursue their true purpose and passions to make a huge impact in the world. I love facilitating “a-ha moments” for people and guiding them towards success. I never thought I would become a coach because I didn’t even know that the coaching industry existed until about 3 years ago. Since then, I learned more about it, volunteered and practiced it as much as I could, and took steps to call this my career. Today, I wanted to answer some FAQs for people who are interested in becoming a coach or adding coaching skills to their repertoire. As you read this, imagine us chatting together at a coffee shop with the freedom for you to pick my brain. My hope is that this gives you more insight to the industry and provides a little bit of direction of your next steps.\\nQ: I love helping people. I’ve always enjoyed mentoring and guiding younger people. Is coaching right for me? A: Yes! The heart of coaching is helping people to figure out what they want, why they want it, and provide the support and accountability for them to be successful. When you get down to it, a coach sees someone for their potential and equips them with the skills and resources for them to be the best version of themselves. A coach is someone who wants to facilitate change, growth, and get people from where they are now to where they want to be. It’s definitely considered to be a “helping profession.” It doesn’t necessarily have to be with someone younger than you, but people tend to work with coaches that they can relate to. The question to ask yourself is, “WHY do you want to become a coach?” Get clear on your definition of success. If it’s genuinely to help people get better in a motivating way, then coaching may be a good fit for you.\\nQ: What are my options as a coach? // What can I do as a coach? A: There are many paths you can take, or make yourself! Typically you could: be to go-to coach for your current company, be a coach that consults for other companies, or start your own private coaching business/practice. There are many different niches as well: including health/wellness, business, life, executive, leadership and success, and career. Or, you could get coach training for basic coach skills (communication, listening, asking questions, goal-setting/accountability) that could equip you to be a better leader in your current job.\\nQ: How can I get started with coaching? A: Start Where You Are! First, if you’ve never experienced working with a coach yourself, I highly encouraged you to do it. That way, you know first-hand what it’s all about. You can go to local workshops and seminars hosted by a coach, or invest in working with one yourself. Then, the best way to see if coaching is right for you as a career is to engage in opportunities to learn and practice coaching. Find people and opportunities where you can offer your listening ear and expertise. If you're working 9-5, what are some ways you can add value to your company by helping others grow? For example, it could be a book club, speaking in a professional development series, or creating an accountability group. The key is to find practical ways to practice (even if it’s on your friends!) Think of it as an experiment: Who do I love to help? What kind of problems are they dealing with? What value am I providing them? Do I even like this?\\nSomething you can try to practice with people one-on-one: create a survey asking questions about people’s needs and desires, send it out to friends and people in your network, and offer a mini-coaching session to those who have filled it out. This gives you a better idea of what people need and are looking for, and also real-world experience in coaching people.\\nQ: Do I need training or certification? A: Getting training is like the difference between between street smart and and school smart. You may naturally have great coaching skills, but training hones them to take to the next level. I like to think of it like the difference between a street basketball player and a professional one. A street basketball player is naturally skilled and may have fun playing the game, but when you’re ready to go pro, training helps provide structure and expertise, and confidence in helping you know what you’re doing. Coach training is an investment and can range from $500-$2000 per module (and even up to $10,000 for the whole shebang), so carefully consider it before going all in. I went to Erickson International, and have heard good things about Co-Active Coach Training, and Lifeforming.\\nCertification is getting officially registered by the International Coach Federation. You need to have at coach training and at least 100 hours in order to apply. It’s a great route to consider if you value professional development, and a must-have if you want to work for corporate companies for executive/leadership coaching. A lot of corporate companies will only hire coaches with those credentials. But if you worked with clients one-on-one in your own private practice, it’s not necessary. Keep in mind that clients buy for results. As long as you provide value and results, clients will be happy to work with you.\\nBuilding a business takes a lot of time and persistence. It’s one thing to be a great coach but it’s another thing to be a great business owner. It takes a lot of focused intention and attention, and it doesn’t happen overnight. I always say that building a business is the BEST personal development because you’re always learning new things (that constantly keep changing) and pushing yourself to grow.\\nPeople don’t buy coaching, they buy results. This is a marketing thing. To more clear you are about who you help and how you help them, they better chance you’ll find the people you’re meant to serve and get paying clients. I naively thought that saying “I can coach!” would attract people to me. Instead, I had to learn some savvy marketing skills and get clear on my audience, message, and services.\\nThings are constantly changing. Things within the industry are constantly changing. The coach I was one year ago is way different than the coach I am today (for the better!) Business is the same way. Things that worked before may not worked now. So I’m constantly experimenting with new marketing channels and offerings. I like the challenge of trying new things, but I’m also balancing it with trying to remain consistent in things like my voice and helpful habits.\\nInvest in things that matter. Some people may think the only expenses needed for an online coaching business is a laptop, internet, and a phone (which you already have). But realistically, start-up costs could be education, training, web site/marketing materials/branding, office supplies, legal fees, etc. Those things add up. It’s good to have a budget to set aside money to invest in things to matter to you. For me, that was education, branding, and working with a coach.\\nQ: What are your favorite books/resources? A: I love reading! Here’s a list of my recommended books for leadership, business, and creativity. I continue to add to the list, so let me know what your recommendations are!\\nI hope this Q+A session helped you get a better peek into our world and give you clarity for the direction of your coach journey. My vision is that someday coaching will become more mainstreamed and that everyone would be equipped with basic coaching skills. Wouldn’t that be AWESOME?!\\nLeave your comments or questions below and SHARE the love on your favorite social media channels!\", 'timestamp': '2019-04-24T11:00:54Z', 'url': 'http://shichencoaching.com/blog/so-you-wanna-be-a-coach'}\n","{'text': 'If you are interested in the new Ram 1500, Dodge Grand Caravan, Jeep Grand Cherokee or Chrysler 300, the Crown Auto World Bristow new car dealership is your connection for a superb inventory of new cars.

The points on 03 seem to be frozen; even though the indicator arrows switch from red to green, the points stay in the same position. Also, whenever I try to run a loco through either turnout, it derails! Close visual inspection does not reveal any immediately obvious reason for this to be happening, and I am moving at less than 10 mph with the points properly set, so I can\\'t see that it\\'s anything I\\'m doing, either.

I consider this not to bad and would accept the HUD not to be correct. The more once the train passed the signal it turned yellow for S 1095S so proofed the HUD is little bit off. Your take and please do not be shy to post something here.\\nTrouble with the 1.0.2 download. I\\'m getting a file not found error. Possibly because the link says crp rather than cpr?\\nHappy New Year to all of you!!!!!!!!\\nI confirm that the download of version 1.0.2 and the installation in Trainz went as expected, ie. no problems at all.\\nThanks for such good service and for such a superb route.\\nThanks Gilles most other Roy\\'s trainzers confirmed also good execution of the new release and yes works as expected, thanks for the ice comment.\\nHi everyone! I want to thank Roy for an AMAZING route (I bought the 3-in-1 CPR Mountain Sub)!! The detail is ridiculous and I cannot even imagine the effort and time it took to create this route. Today I spent some time reading the new PDF instructions for the CMTM System (http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showt...7-CMTM-Upgrade) and was wondering if anyone else other than myself is crazy enough to attempt creating at least one session utilizing it. It seems like a daunting endeavor and I have no doubt that it would be an intense effort. However, I believe that a few of us dedicated enough may be able to team up and put something quite impressive together for this equally impressive route. Anyone have any thoughts or ideas? I especially would like Roy to chime in here too. Thanks!\\nEnough industries to do the first steps with lumber industries rolling stock and truck bringing the lumber from the forest..eg.\\n64WarHorse, yes, I think that there are enough industries, esp if you include the whole Mountain Sub. Not to even mention what Roy here has proposed (integrating it into his upcoming additional route(s)). CMTM does support all sorts of cool scenarios as mentioned by Roy, not just yard/switching duties specifically. I am in the process of learning the new CMTM version (v.4) and would gladly contribute as much time/effort that I can to developing some sessions if we do it in a team fashion. :) Maybe we can start small at first and make some very basic sessions/scenarios to see how it goes. If all works out well then we can collaborate and come up with some truly epic sessions for these awesome routes! This idea is very exciting for me and if some of you share my enthusiasm (esp Roy), I really think we could build something legendary here. Idk. Maybe we can pull DAP (CMTM creator) into this somehow too.\\nOkay, colour me intrigued. So where do we start? I suppose the first question would be, do we need to modify any rolling stock for CMTM?\\nThis is the most expensive ad-on I have ever bought, but I consider it worth every penny.\\nKeep the spirit high. :) I really look forward to following the devlopment of Your project.\\nSteve i agree i will tell Ray to change the background in a neutral easy to read color monday! promise!\\nChrisD yeeeehhh wow that feels good you like it as so many did already before you and yes it is a marvel and yes worth every penny you spent There is so much to discover it will take you a lot of time to find out and still not see it all,........that means yes i spent a lot of time creating this and hope to finish the next section soon.\\nRailworks user here that just had to see what Trainz was capable of in its most extreme! Picked up Trainz on 75% discount and bought the Rogers Pass route from your site. The level of detail in this route is amazing. Im a routebuilder in Railworks, and I know how long it takes to build anything. I cant imagine it being any different in Trainz.. Your work is really and I mean really fantastic! Its all in the details as they say and your route has it all. Take care all and thanks again for your hard work Roy!\\nHello all! Sorry for the few days absence but I\\'ve been quite busy lately. Anyway, I am almost done reading and re-reading the CMTM documentation and would soon like to start collaborating with those of you interested in helping me out with some basic CMTM session ideas and subsequently creation. All of those interested should PM me on the main Trainz forums thread and send me their e-mail addresses so we can communicate more efficiently. Or, feel free to e-mail me directly at runthat1@gmail.com.\\nsaw that one too1 I did straighten a track segment and did not realize the signposts were separate and so got this cosmetic error. Moved the post and fixed already, thanks for reporting.\\nThank you for this nice route it is wel very long to drive cpr mountain sub -)) my wife is killing me.\\nGuillaume, i cannot advice you what is a less of more painful death, killed by your wife or trainz excitement, lol.\\nThanks 4 sharing, Ning laughs she understand.\\nHopefully this will work in TS12, seeing errors as I install, previous versions errors, warnings. All help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for the routes!\\nall related to JVC grass items by author jankvis.\\nmissing deps or unknown deps 99% of the time are caused by to many cdp\\'s installed at the same time in Content Manager Program!

Now for that latte, sit back, relax and enjoy.\\nThursday Feb 27th I will upload release 1.03 of the CPR Mountain Sub. Claim yours by sending an email to me and i will link an upload for you. Have a great week!\\ndid you have any succes implementing the CMTM system for our routes? let us know what the current status is ok?\\nHello! Sorry for the lack of updates, but I was out-of-state enjoying Mardi Gras in New Orleans for a few weeks. :) But yes, CMTM DOES work with the routes and it works quite well actually. I had started to collaborate with another member here but he hasn\\'t replied to my last e-mail. He had some VERY good session ideas which I was excited to work on with him. He had suggested doing multiple CMTM sessions, each one building upon the previous one(s). I will attempt to contact him again. Otherwise, I, myself, have begun testing CMTM implementation on the CPR Mountain Sub route (3-in-1) and am now trying to come up with some of my own session ideas. If ANYONE else here would like to help, PLEASE contact me via e-mail or PM on the forums.\\nMardi Gras that has been a while for me.... very nice time!\\nWell CMTM that sounds good, let me know when you have something for me to test here and give ideas to you as feedback. If lucky not to long we have a connection to the Laggan sub to run real CMTM!\\nKeep up the excellent work and keep me in the pict.\\nCPR Mountain Sub release 1.0.3 is ready for dl.\\nemail me and I open in your account for dl!\\nHello all! I must apologize for the delay in providing any updates regarding implementing CMTM 4 on the CPR Mountain Sub. I am just starting to get over a nasty bout with bronchitis/upper respiratory infection and have not been able to devote much time to Trainz or much else aside from sleep (and coughing my lungs out). Steve (I am now unsure of his Trainz username here) contacted me awhile ago about his interest and desire to help me get some CMTM sessions thought-out and started. I will be contacting him later today to continue to work out the details of some of his ideas (which are really awesome btw!!). Not going to ruin the surprise or anticipation, but due to the route\\'s huge size and unique layout of industries, yards, and portals to subsequent routes that Roy has mentioned, the sessions Steve has suggested as some possibilities really do a great job of taking those factors into account.\\nRoy, yes!, CMTM 4 can and DOES work with the route(s) and YES!, it should definitely be something you take into consideration for future updates, upgrades, and new routes/expansions. Steve and I both came to the same conclusion that adding CMTM to existing rolling stock is a very simple matter of just adding some lines to the config.txt files. However this poses a potential problem with the original content creators\\' licensing/hosting mandates. I am not sure what to do about this potential issue, but I am sure we will find a way.\\nkep up the good work guys, i work hard to get the daunting task of texturing over and over again certain areas to my liking but as i get older (like all of you) every day, day by day I get more picky and say to myself time is not of the essence, quality, pride of work and fun of doing it makes the difference.\\nif this continues I close the blog and concentrate only on supporting you guys my unbelievable nice cosy and great roys trainz family. SP1 is the door closer for me with trainz although I will support you guys to the end of the 5 major routes for the next years to come and look seriously for another alternative than N3V.\\ni not understand what fun they have spamming this blog. there is no financial gain nor fight or dispute of any kind related unless they show their face like we do.\\nugly but it seems to make them happen.\\nGarbage not only fills our oceans and kills habitat.\\nI just finished testing a way around the grotesque bug existing for years far as TRS 2009 and now even blocking my routes from working with tunnels.\\nIt is not a copmplete guarantee it should work now for you to so pls dl it and test it once I uploaded only CPR marked as 57720_CPR. i not upgrade any smaller route instead I will teach you how to spli them yourselves from a certain release for your own enjoyment. Kepp all routes updated is to much work right now and easier to split the biog one local at your desk.\\nYess, they failed to block me here is a version that will work at least it does on my computer 57720! I will now start prep upload for the route with tunnels working but its new tunnels not the old one i did change little things in the config too of the tunnels.\\nOk just uploade the latest CPR version working with big tunnels in 57720 SP1 and also uploade the 577203rdparty_fix for deps new tunnels you need to dl again. sorry for the incovenience but thank N3V for all the mishap and fuzz they create and deny.\\nI am not sure how to update my Rogers Pass to SP1. Please advise.\\nNiels send me an email and acc namr and see what we can do ok?\\nMaybe You should take a look at Open Rails when You get a few moments to spare.\\nThis is where I have moved after giving up on TS12 and its \"Service Pack\".\\nThis freeware Train Simulator (at 0.8 rev 1561) uses at present existing MSTS Routes, but is running on 4 cores and is revised several times each week.\\nBug reporting and fixing is a breeze compared to N3V, and the team even works for nothing.\\nVisual range from the CAB, where I am supposed to be when I drive a train, is 4 Km´s and can be set even higher If You want to, but 4 Km´s is GREAT sustaining a 100+ frame rate.\\nThe driving experience is CLASSES Higher than Trainz.\\nSorry for rubbing salt in Your wound, but my wound is just as great thanks to N3V, and You said in a previous post that You might change platform.\\nJust wanted to let you know that after a fresh install of TS12 SP1 and CPR Mountain Sub 57720 I am simply amazed.\\nNever before have I been able to run with 5000MT draw successfully. Usually I cannot even open up the CPR as it locks up my computer. I have never been able to run it with all sliders maxed out but with TS12 SP1 and CPR 57720 I have no problems.\\nThe graphics are a huge improvement as is the sound.\\nIn fact the only minor issue I have is a slight stutter when the scenery detail slider is on normal or high with the other sliders at max value. Smooth as silk if scenery detail is on low. this is unheard of on my humble computer. I will play with the slider settings a little more as I am sure there is a better compromise re the stutter.\\nI have kept the TS12 pre SP1 install just in case, but I am really loving the 57720 version so much.\\nI will report back after testing in a heavy yard area and with other trains about.\\nThat\\'s all for now, Andrew.\\nsorry to hear you leave.\\nWell if Open rails has a modeller similar to trainz or better, if the dbase of 3rd party freeware objects to choose from is similar or better, if there is a way to \"move\" \"recreate the same DEM, networks, road,splines and locations of existing objects ....what else.\\nI know the problem, and there is no easy solution.\\nAs for the assets, there may be a way forward. Most assets are built with some kind of 3D modeller, and if the raw files (before export to Trainz) is at hand they can be exported to MSTS as well.\\nI am sure we will never get to a quater of a million assets, but right now N3V is voiding a batch of these, so..\\nI not need all dls items so far 400 are faulty in my trainz dbase. ouch but can live with it for the moment.\\nthanks for your support dear friend say hello home from all of us!!\\nNew version of CPR Mountain Sub TS14 release 1.0.5 now available.\\njust uploaded the 1.0.5 release which runs very nice and is the best ever driver version so far in 10 years! Scenery and quality is beyond expectations and a complete surprise probably for N3V too they never check or report things anyway.\\nOGL is now finally the way to go and has better fps too when tweaking your Nvidia.\\nPersonally I am most happy with driver as the speedtrees and my textures now do VERY well!!!\\nI just made a free roam around Your route and the memory usage peaked at 2,454,000 Kb, so Trainz definately uses more than the usual 2 Gb. And, no locking or long thinking pauses.\\nRoy, thanks again, I have donwloaded all 1.0.5, do I need all these if I have the previous version?\\nIf you dl already earlier revs deps you not need to dl again same.\\nChris thanks for the link it seems to work better than expected!\\nIs there a way to undo the 4GB patch? My trainz.exe file is changed, cannot apply patch #2. Thanks.\\nyou run into the same booby trap too like me.\\nCurrently i make some backups of older TS212 versions to an old HDD but a slow one. After done I will than carefully upgrdae another 57720 on my SSD and install same way you do.\\nI lost my major HDD backup disk incl my original TS12 files from trainz setup. Not in the mood now to see if i can dl them again from trainz... Maybe when we finished supplying N#V with all the bugs they will fix them for the next TS14 for sure and use us as their testers like always.\\nthere is and never will be a rollback from them so when goes wrong you have to uninstall reinstall crazy but true as far as I know.\\nkeep me us posted and you can post in roy doors thread so other can learn from it.\\nThat is Your original file. Just delete the Trainz.exe and rename tha backup.\\nOk guys this evening uploaded tons of kuids upgraded to trainz build 3.5 to be used in TS12 49922 and 87898.\\nIf your interested dl the 5 groups on the deps page of your profile.\\nRoy, just found your website by chance, looked at your route pics. they are the best I\\'ve seen. You are an artist.\\nFor all those using the CPR Mountain freeware route with s301 ZR grasses which unfortunately not do the job at all. I did replace them today but the route is not updated yet.\\nHere is a way to use replace assets and you can dl via your profile the Pofig-JVC frewware cdp with the grasses needed.\\nI did work on a proper replacement for the S301 grasses for the freeware grass version of the CPR route.\\nI thought that those from jvc in the pofig lib could do the job till one decides to change/upgrade to ST_2 grasses if he/she likes them more.\\nfind near track following item \"ZR~(Gr-1)Grass R-Dark green-2 mtr\"\\nopen in surveyor main menu replace assets and place this object in left side as assets to replace!\\nclick current selection only to make it replace all in the route!\\n\"3D1_Pg-JVC_gr1_22\" is asset to replace with!\\n3D1_Pg-JVC_gr2_58 asset to replace with!\\nIn case you are not familiar with I can make tomorrow a short video how to but bet you know this command how to use.\\nRoy, a query please. I am in the process of writing a Session for CPR to be uploaded (hopefully) to the DLS.\\nI have the freeware S301 grasses at the moment. If I replace them with the 3D1 grasses does your map still retain your kuid?\\nIf I upload a Session with S301 grasses will other players with other versions of grasses still be able to download and play a Session from the DLS?\\nI not have experience with creating sessions to that level of detail how trainz would handle it bit from the surveyor handling this it should work as long as the other side has the same grass it will show that grass.\\nMost probably the session would have missing deps (grasses) if the other party not have those grasses in his/her dbase.\\nWe have to test this and see or discuss with other more experienced session users on the forum.\\nThe eeasiest and most forward way for you however would be to make these grasses Gr... now used mandatory to dl and install when someone dl your session.\\nI have never used Replace Assets before so I\\'m not sure if it also replaces your kuid with mine for the map. That would be no good to upload a Session to the DLS.\\nI\\'ll play safe for the moment and keep to the S301 grasses until my Session is released. After that I can experiment.\\nI think you are right in that another player would have missing deps but that should\\'nt affect the playability of the Session.\\nBTW, what is the correct spelling. Illecillweat or Illecillwaet? Both are used in the map. I would like to know the correct one for use in html messages.\\nBefore you release any session on the dls make sure that not inadvertedly parts of the payware route are linked or available thru the session on the dls.\\nI never used sessions in depth but I think i saw once a large route file linked in the sessions data file that was the major part of the route.\\nThis we have to avoid you understand.\\nReplace asset is easy and handy so pls use it and let me now the new grasses do the job.\\nIllecillewaet is the correct name.\\nI understand your concerns about people getting hold of your route through other means. That will not happen with me. I shall be uploading 2 files to the DLS when ready. One is the Session and the other is a HTML file which will contain the instructions, messages, etc.\\nNothing of your route is included apart from your kuid in the Session config.txt that gives the map being used. What this means is that if someone hasn\\'t bought the route and downloads the Session, they won\\'t be able to play it as the route will be a \\'Missing Dependency\\'.\\nWith your permission I\\'ll add into the DLS description that the Session uses a Payware route only available from you at Roy\\'s Trainz. You never know, it might bring in a few extra sales! If someone has already bought the route then everything is peachy.\\nI\\'ve started the Session at Revelstoke CPR Yard and have now reached Illecillewaet (correct spelling thanks).\\nI\\'ll tidy up here and save a backup to external HD before I try replacing the grasses.\\nthanks for the nice post and agree with you.\\nSorry for the late approval of the post.\\nMy webmaster adviced me to go this cumbersome way to approve outside posts since hackers/spammers keep bombarding the website relentlessly what fun they think they have is unclear to me but this world has more unclear habits and things happening.\\nThanks for the reply. I agree with you, these hackers are a menace.\\nI installed the grasses ok but what I feared would happen, did. I could only save them in a new map with my kuid. This of course is no good as I need to upload a Session for use with your map, your kuid.\\nWhat I think I\\'ll do is to continue on to Wakely and stop there. I\\'ll upload the Session and explain that it can only be played with your S301 map. I\\'ll wait and see if there is any positive interest/feedback before deciding whether to carry on to Golden.\\nDon\\'t bother replying to this post. I\\'ll put future posts on the Forum and let N3V worry about the hackers.\\nIf you go into the config of your session and change the route map the session refers to than, anyone who has the CPR in any form but different grasses eg should be able to run the route/session.\\nWhen you have a test for me i can proof what I say when you ready.\\nI have done this dozen times when a session linked to an older CPR version I wanted to link to a newer, changed the config map kuid the session has to run on and done.\\nI understand what you mean when updating Sessions but this is your own kuid on your own computer and Trainz recognises this.\\nWhen I replaced the grasses I can only save it in my kuid which Trainz gives me, like it or not.\\nFor instance: your map 122860:100035, after installing and saving the new grasses has now become 90608:100027, the 90608 being my kuid.\\nThis is fine as long as I don\\'t want to upload the map to anywhere. It may now be in my kuid but doesn\\'t belong to me.\\nI think the way to go is to release the Session with the default map 122860:100035. I will add an instruction on how to change the map kuid in the Session to whatever they have on their system. This will not infringe your copyright as any player must have bought your original map before they can update grasses.\\nAll very complicated so I\\'ll leave that for now until I get the Session finished.\\nI\\'ll come back to you at that time to see about testing.\\ndefying 58414 little critters and bugs the Rogers Pass passed my QA tests with \"flying colors\" after crashing first time after 2 hours without any normal reason than the exisitng Trainz bug.\\nThe route is now ready for dl for those interested in a 58414 1.07 version of this section.\\nAbout wich trainz TS12 versions support my routes. Simple and straight forward ALL releases work 100% and dependencies of the route are all working and links for dl provided. It cannot be more simple and all in one place.If for any reason you feel well with the 49922 version dl this one from your account profile.I use the 58414 as the driver here runs particularly well, but earlier versions no problem.\\nCan i ask what the file size is for the whole Route please Roy ?, Like to download the whole thing mate i am on a limited wireless service here and it would take for ever to download if the Route and Deps is too big. And does it only come in a winter version ?. Loks pretty cool the whole thing.\\nsorry I just now checked the blog to see for comments that need approval. Many times hackers and sorts of try to ruin one\\'s day and for unknown reason and sick pleasure that never works at least not with us.\\nOk the size of the entire route is a cdp/zip 199 MB! not that big even for a limited internet connection and my site has fast acces so dl would work fine.\\nThe deps are all grouped in smaller ones and also setup to fit as you said ltd acces internet connections.\\nI am very pleased to see you around here and we would be more than happy to welcome you to our community. You will love it and yes the winter/seasonal groundtextures for a auto pre and post winter experience is included.\\nCheck my thread there are somewhere also winterpictures around.\\nThis should get you on the tracks with Roy\\'s trainz.\\nThanks Roy i\\'ll certainly grab it at sum stage mate, Few other projects i want to take care of first though so thanks again.\\nHate to be a pain again mate sorry but can i ask one more question, If i have not updated to the latest patchs for TS12 can i still use your Route ?. Or would i have to patch to the latest build ?. Thanks Roy.\\nyes when you purchase my routes it will show you what to dowload for eg. 49922 WIN and MAC version and in case the 58414 release the coresponding CPR route working/updated for the version of TS12.\\nAlso I did \"update a lot of built-in and other used cdp\\'s to actualize them as far as feasible to run well on 58414.\\nthese routes look awesome, i\\'m currently downloading alot of stuff for other software and will buy CPR Mountain Subdivision in a couple of hours. I hope the download includes everything needed to run the route because i\\'m new to Trainz12. Thank You Roy for your work of Art :) Harry from Montreal, Canada.\\nyou make my birthday a complete success. thanks for the very nice comment.\\nWelcome to Roys Trainz and YES there is one page containing ALL needed deps at your fingertips.\\nOMG, WOW! Roy you\\'re awesome! I just finished installing \"Rogers Pass\" and I am in shock at how beautiful the route looks in TS12. Your payware even looks better than Railworks TS2014......BRAVO!\\nDo you remember if I have all the routes when I bought the $70 combo? If not, which one do I not have? Curious, thank you for all your hard work and beautiful creative things.\\nThe 3 in combo means that you bought the CPR Mountain Sub from Ottertail all the way to west of Revelstoke.\\nI made for a limited time 3 separate \"smaller\" routes cutting/overlapping with the huge CPR MOUNTAIN connecting them via Iportals.\\nThe \"smaller 3 sep routes\" where temporarily I want to allow people to taste at \"entry\" level before deciding to go for the big one.\\nSome users liked the smaller ones to run a few hours i.o. of 9 up all day.\\n99% bought and uses the CPR MOUNTAIN SUB.\\nI did not anticipate so much work due to several bugs in any trainz version when cutting. Imagine eg deleting a baseboard does not mean all data within and crossing is deleted and you and up with \"invisble floating elements\" ouside your cut route.\\nthis morning Richard post on my trainz forum threads very touching post indeed!\\n\"Hi Roy and everyone else who views this thread.\\n5 days ago I had been in Trainz exile for around 4 years. If I am totally honest I didn\\'t think I would ever take an interest in Trainz again having drifted onto other things. On Sunday afternoon I stumbled across The Kickstarter Project \"Trainz Simulator - A New Era\". Initially I made a modest pledge, I liked the idea and the more I read about it, the more my interest in the future of Trainz was growing. The fire was lit and within a few hours I was back on the Kickstarter page increasing my pledge. At this point I was going to take a back seat and strap myself in for the ride and watch the next 4 weeks unfold. It didn\\'t stop there though, I still couldn\\'t stop at pledge number 2. I decided I needed a bigger slice of the action and pledge number 3 was made within 24 hours of me starting all this. Having got this far and making a commitment to the future of Trainz it was time to dust down my last version of the game Trainz 2009 and take a look. I had remembered fondly how much I enjoyed Trainz 2004 and Trainz 2006 along with Trainz classics, although if I am honest winding the clock back 4 years and looking at Trainz 2009 did little to enhance my new found enthusiasm for the Trainz Kickstarter project.\\nTaking the above into consideration it was time to research the current version of trainz and try and establish what the best available routes for Trainz 12 were. This is where I stumbled across Roys Trainz and after browsing his site and the forums I knew instantly I wasn\\'t going to wait for my Get Trainz Now selection from the Kickstarter Pledge. I bought Trainz 12 along with CPR-Mountain-Sub TS14 and It\\'s one of the best decisions I have ever made.\\nThe Route is absolutely stunning Roy and is a credit to you.\\nI look forward to seeing your work hit new heights in future versions of trains.\\nain\\'t that something wow feels good and gives lots of energy.\\nThe day after Dec.17th we all feel much better KS first step reached and more streched goals will make it for sure.\\nThanks all the trainzers who supported vie my website and of course all those that pledged on the official KS and trainz website!!!\\nFor those new to my website asking how come this blog is not very active, the reason is simple we use the main Trainz forum my trheads and thus reach at the same time other trainzers not part (yet) of the Roy\\'s Trainz family.\\nIf you like to share on my threads that you pledged also thru my routes please post over there and here of course.\\nI respect eachothers privacy and not publish a list.\\nHappy Holidays and Happy New Trainz year and 2014!\\nwilliam asked me today in an email if my routes work on TS 12 he bought from steam.\\nYes all my routes work on TS12 and all versions, see on this website when you click more on the CPR Mountain Sub it show TS12 version number and windows and or MAC version number.\\nWell, finally we did it the Laggan sub section West is ready to download.\\nfurther posts and comments we do as usual on the trainz forum in my threads Canadian rocky Mountains 2011 and others i opened there.\\n\"I just downloaded the Columbia River Basin and it is the most amazing, most detailed route in trainz! It took me in a CP ES44AC running at track speed almost 3 hours to get done! of course I met 2 trains along the way and had to follow a northbound CN grain, but it was amazing! Super fun, super realistic, and totally worth the $25! Every person that has trainz 12 download this now!!!!\"\\nMid summer for most on this globe activity still high on roystrainz!! Most users know this blog is kind of sleepy as most activity blog etc is on trainz forum so please follow up over there to avoid double traffic.\\nAt this moment i try to solve a mysterious bug on a beautiful very intelligent way of session automated traffic for CPR Mountain Sub created by my good dutch fellow friend Henk.

In case you are interested in the results email me or post on my threads on trainz forum.\\nWell we did it and cleared all winter tracks into Ottertail and further to Viktor Lake. Now ready for download is the all NEW CPR MOUNTAIN SUB SEASONAL with 4 seasons and much more and yes for future TANE use ready to migrate to that level when they are ready. In the mean time you can enjoy this gem the fullest in TS12 and maybe appreciate more now that TS12 with the so many shortcomings still is a nice piece of sim. It is sad to say how people ravage over TANE CE a not finished product (never should be released) as most trainzer have no clue what it takes to get a finished product until the final day of official release.\\nSo i released yesterday some 300 plus seasonal assets. you will find them on the download page when you have bought the CPR Mountain Sub 1.0.9 look for the route 1.0.9 seasonal.\\nStill some more to do but that is for later now finish the TANE speedtrees first release for my routes.\\nWell at least the curtain starts moving in the TANE 3D theatre announcing wazz up and coming \"soon\". Yes they start with the Columbia River Basin followed by all the other one\\'s all new routes so much bigger,wider,more details than ever before and much much more to come all in super realistic mode and not to forget protypical!!\\nOnce all routes in TANe are out there the TS12 routes will fade out slowly and close an era we all enjoyed so much. You can post here but I prefer you do on my Canadian Rocky Mountains thread in the trainz frorum. A little bit more patience to iron out little critters and cracks by the N3V crew. they have a mountain of routes from me to get ready so give them credit and energy to get things done the soonest and well.\\nGlad Roy is still up and kickin\\'!!!', 'timestamp': '2019-04-19T10:45:15Z', 'url': 'http://www.roystrainz.com/blog/post/so-here-we-are-ready-start-blog-division-roys-trainz/'}\n","{'text': 'Continue reading \"The Daily 3: What Makes Me Happy\"\\nI dig the design you picked!

What about a mattress for back or stomach sleepers? Why is there a mattress designed specifically for side sleepers? The mattress must meet the unique needs that a side sleeper needs. The mattress should have a good temperature control so the person can sleep comfortably. The mattress should be reasonably priced and specifically designed for people who like to habitually sleep on their sides. The mattress must give this type of sleeper strong support for their backs, necks and legs, and feet. If the person likes to bend their legs while they sleep or they like to sleep with their legs straight the mattress must be able to meet these needs. This is why memory foam would be good to have so it will form to the person’s peculiar sleeping position.\\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress is supposed to have 3.5 gel memory foam that conforms to your body. It Will keep the spine aligned and prevent tossing and turning during the night. It does not allow for motion transfer and it will help you have a great night’s sleep. It is lined with New Zealand wool which absorbs moisture and controls the temperature. It will also stop odor from absorbing into the mattress. It contains no harsh chemicals or chemicals that are flame retardant. The mattress is great for side sleepers and the company offers a limited 25 year limited warranty. The mattress is rolled up and compressed into the box for easy shipping.\\nFeedback: The mattress had over 2200 review written about it. The customer has rheumatoid arthritis and says she can sleep on the sorest parts of her body and she has no pain. The pressure points are fine and she woke up at 7:30 in the morning and she felt like she had slept until 11:00 a.m. She was afraid to sleep on memory foam but she now has no reservations about it.\\nThe customer said they researched the product thoroughly and decided to buy this memory foam mattress. He had tried several other memory foam mattresses in the past. He ordered the product and it was delivered to the front door. The customer was told the box weighed 102 lbs. and the customer was impressed with how compact the mattress was in the box. He dragged the box to the bed the mattress was to go on. He took it out of the box and he let the mattress air out for s night. He slept in another room and the next night he slept on the new mattress. He slept fine until 3:00 am and then he woke up with the sweats. He slept off and on until the morning. He slept on the mattress the next night but he put a fan near the mattress to cool it down. The fan got the room to cool so he had to set the fan at a higher speed. He developed an acute tailbone lower backache. He could not afford this injury because he does heavy lifting at his work. He decided to return the product so he contacted Amazon. The rep said since the mattress had human contact that Amazon could not return the product. The rep said his credit card would be fully reimbursed. He could not believe Amazon would give the money back without taking the mattress back. Amazon told him to give the mattress away. The customer rated the product 2-stars. You cannot blame him for giving the product such a low-rating.\\nThe customer says this is the best mattress he has ever had except for a very expensive one his ex got to keep. This mattress did not sink in the middle or lose his form. He has had very good nights of sleep on the mattress and he gave it a 5-star rating. He highly recommends the product. This is a great mattress for the price. the customer says they have the mattress for a month and so far so good. The mattress is firm and the client likes to sleep on firm mattresses.\\nThe customer is disabled and cannot go to the store to try out a mattress to see what it is really like before he would buy it. He tried this mattress and was disgusted with it because it was not firm at all. He showed a picture of himself sitting on the mattress. It sagged a good 6 to 8 inches when the mattress was 13 inches high. It is definitely not a firm mattress. The customer is tired of reading reviews that do not meet his expectations concerning the product. He thinks maybe the reviews are fake because they seem to be wrong most of the time. Being a disabled person he really needs the reviews to accurately reflect the quality of the product. He called Amazon and they said to give the mattress away but we will still fully refund your money. He likes the way Amazon takes care of the customers. The customer rated the product one-star.\\nThe couple bought the mattress 3 years ago and they are disgusted with the product. They slept well on it at first but now they wake up in the morning with aches and pains. The mattress sagged in certain spots making it tougher to sleep. The rotated the mattress to try and alleviate the sags it did not work. They could not flip the mattress over because the thickness on the bottom is different than on the top. The customer said this mattress is only 3-years-old and is a lousy product. The customers rated the product 2-stars. The mattress was a solid mattress and it was easy to set up. The wife and husband were people of average weight so they cannot understand why the mattress would sag. They will not buy the product again and they do not recommend the product.\\nBenefits and Uses: It is a knitted polyester and tencel blended fabric which will relieve tension on your shoulders and hips. The mattress is great for side sleepers and is so soft you will think you’re sleeping in the clouds. The mattresses 4 layers will have you sleeping in optimal comfort. The top panel supplies you with comfort. The memory gel section alleviates pressure and gives you support while you sleep. The internal breathable layer keeps you cool while you sleep. The foundational layer comes in soft, medium, and firm designations. You order what you want. The mattress comes with a 10-year non-prorated warranty and a 120 night comfort guarantee.\\nFeedback: The customer said the mattress came in 18 inches and 41 inches square. It came in a heavy plastic shipping bag and it was easy to roll out of the bag. The customer put it on the mattress box and they waited two hours to sleep on the mattress. Contrary to what they had read and heard the mattress had no odor. The customer said they slept well on the mattress and that it was a foam mattress and not a memory mattress. The customer is right it is not a memory mattress but a foam mattress. The customer does not want a memory mattress. The customer rated the product 5-stars.\\nThe customer rated the product 5-stars and said it was very easy to set up. The product is very comfortable and this is all the customer writes. This is not a detailed review and tells us nothing about the quality of the product. Why is it great? Is it firm? Is it soft? The customer does not say why they rated the product 5-stars. The customer does not write if they slept soundly during the night or that they woke up refreshed in the morning. We do not know if the customer woke up in pain or if any previous pains were alleviated. This review has no selling value for future customers. The review is too general and neutral to convince anyone to buy or not to buy the product.\\nThis is not a very positive review because the customer rated the product 3-stars. Which really is an average rating. The customer bought a medium and firm mattress. The couple decided to sleep on the firm mattress and put the medium mattress in the guest room. The wife has had back issues for years and needed the firm support. The husband weighs 200 lbs and needs to find a comfortable position to sleep in. The firm mattress met this requirement. Despite this seemingly positive review, the customer rated the product 3-stars which sends strong mixed signals. The review will not convince people to buy the product.\\nThe customer says the mattress is like sleeping on a cloud as they said in their own words. They tried the mattress in the store and the longer they laid on it the better they liked it. They selected the firm mattress and they have rated the product 5-stars. They wrote the review the day this article was written 7/16/2018. So, it remains to be seen what the customer thinks about the product down the road.\\nThe customer pays the mattress was easy to set up and is comfortable to sleep on but they did not say why it was easy to set up or why it was so comfortable for them to lay on. The customer rated the product 5-stars. Two women wrestled the box mattress upstairs without any extra help. They said once you get it out the box take it right to where it will be slept on. This is because the mattress once it comes out of the box it expands rapidly so you do not have a lot of time to move the mattress. They put it in the guest room but quickly moved it to the master bedroom because it was too good to leave in the guest room. The mattress is nice and the customer rated the product 5-stars.\\nBenefits and Uses: Hopefully the mattress is worthy of the robust price tag it carries-$3599 which is very expensive. The mattress is 11.8 inches thick and it is made of temperature material. Or it will control the temperature as you sleep giving you a comfortable sleep. It helps to spread the body weight evenly across the bed helping you to sleep without waking up sore in the morning. The cover is made of breathable, cooling material that keeps the surface of the mattress cool. The mattress material is designed with cooling benefits and it draws heat from the body.\\nFeedback: The customer says the mattress is working very well for them. They use to lay down and could not sleep and on top of it they would wake up sore. Now, with this mattress as soon as they lay down they fall asleep. They wake up in the morning without feeling sore. They would wake up every morning sore when they slept on the other mattress. The client rated it 5-stars. The customer says they wanted to wait before they wrote this review and the finally got around to writing the review. They wanted to sleep on the bed for awhile before making a report and they wrote their report. The customer said they always thought they would sleep on a coil mattress but they bought this one instead.\\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress is designed to controls the temperature while you sleep and the memory gel contours to the body for a top night of sleep. 2 inches of memory foam sit on 8 inches of density foam with a soft foam cover. Like so many other mattresses the gel foam draws heat away from the body.\\nFeedback: The customer at first did not like the mattress because it gave her a “sinking” feeling. She sank in the mattress and it felt mushy. She called the rep and the rep said they would send a firmer mattress. But after 3 days the mattress became firmer and the customer fell in love with the mattress and canceled the order for a firmer mattress. The customer kept the medium mattress and she is sleeping very comfortably. Her husband loves the mattress as well and the customer is not waking up hot and sweaty during the night. The customer has rated the mattress 5-stars.\\nThe customer has been using the mattress for quite awhile and it is just as supportive as it was on day one. The twin mattresses are working wonderfully for the customer and the bed doubles as a daybed and a night bed. The customer flips the mattress around but due to construction, the mattress cannot be flipped over. The customer weighs 140 pounds so keep this in mind as you read the review. If you are heavier than this customer’s 140 lbs the bed may not work for you. The Customer says the mattress is as good as some mattresses that may cost a lot more than this one. The customer would buy the mattress again. The customer expects the mattress to last for years. The customer rated the product 5-stars.\\nThe customer bought this mattress to replace a $1200 dollar mattress the client owned before. This mattress is as good as that $1200.00 dollar mattress. The mattress was easy to set up and the customer is the mattress is working very well. The customer sleeps peacefully every night on the mattress. The customer says it is worth 5-stars and will update in the future if any problems arise. The customer said the odor from the mattress dissipated quickly and the customer was glad about this.\\nBenefits and Uses: The mattress has 2.5 inches of gel material on the top with 8.5 inches of deluxe base material. Supposedly the mattress brings a top luxury hotel feel to the home according to the company. The company claims that 90% of the reviews rated the mattress 5-stars. The mattress is able to relieve pressure points which prevents you from tossing and turning all night. The product will relieve shoulder, back and hip pain. The mattress is supposed to give you a delightful night of sleep.\\nFeedback: The company did not tell the truth they said 90% of the reviews were 5-stars. There were 77% of the reviews that rated the product 5-stars. Oh, this is great because the customer receives the mattress and the customer opens the box and finds some of the seams on the mattress were ripping on a brand-new mattress. The delivery guy will not take the mattress back because it is opened. The customer needs to return the mattress. What are they supposed to do now? It sure seems like the company cannot be trusted because they lied about how many 5-star reviews they received for the product and now this customer receives a new mattress that has seams ripping.\\nWe have taken a look at some mattresses that will help you if you are a side sleeper and they will help you sleep comfortably with no aches or pains when you wake up in the morning. One downside in the reviews is one of the company’s lied about how many 5-stars reviewed they received for their mattress. It would be to a customer’s advantage to avoid this company. You will see which company it is in the review list above.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-23T04:14:36Z', 'url': 'https://www.activebeautiful.com/best-mattress-for-side-sleepers/'}\n","{'text': 'Sq. Ft.

Rowling, Harry Potter finds out that he can communicate with snakes using the Parseltongue language.\\nIn this challenge we will write a Python script to translate English to Parseltongue and vice-versa.\\nTo encode a message into Parseltongue you need to insert the string sequence “sss” between each character of your message. e.g.\\nI can speak to snakes using Parseltongue.\\nTo decode a message from Parseltongue remove the “sss” character sequences by only keeping 1 character out of 4 from the encoded message.\\nCheck the following code, which uses two subroutines (functions) called encode() and decode() to encode a message in Parseltongue or decode a message from Parseltongue. Both functions use a technique called string concatenation to add one letter at a time to the message or cypher being generated.\\nDid you know? Encoding and decoding secret messages is a key application of Computer Science called cryptography. An encoded message is called a cipher.\\nAs a wizard at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, Harry Potter often needs to decipher secret messages. In this set of challenges you will write Python subroutines to encode or decode secret messages using a range of techniques.\\nThe Parseltongue coding technique described above is not very secure. It would be easy for anyone to look at a cipher text and to be able to find a way to decipher it without being told how to in the first instance.\\nTo make this encryption technique more secure we will adapt the encode() function implemented in the trinket above. Instead of adding the string “sss” after each character we will add three random letters.\\nBy completing this challenge, we are going to learn how to use ASCII code when manipulating strings.\\nYou will use the chr() and ord() python instructions to convert characters into ASCII code and vice versa.\\nprint(chr(97)) would display the letter “a” on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character “a”.\\nprint(ord(“a”)) would display the 97 on screen as 97 is the ASCII code for character “a”.\\nUse this code to tweak the the encode() function. The decode() function should not need to be updated and should still work with this new encryption technique.\\nTest your code.

Your encode() function will take two parameters, message1 and message2, and generate a cipher by intertwining each letter of both messages, one letter at a time.\\nIn cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the message to encrypt is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\\nYou will find out more about this technique by following this link.\\nCan you think of any other approach you could use to encrypt a message?

A colour or texture catches your eye, and you\\'re hooked. The itch starts, and you find you have to paint it. Whatever it might be. This happened for me a couple of years ago, when I was working with the lovely Vital Veg at Midmar. Every week I packed beautiful, colourful veg into veg bags for customers. Some of the veg came home with me. And some of that came with me to the weekly art class I was attending.\\nAnother influence fed into this process. A few years ago, I attended a workshop with Sofia Perina-Miller, whose work I also greatly admire. She paints fabulous striking flowers, as well as many other subjects. She showed us how to paint directly onto paper, without doing any initial drawing. This was an entirely new experience for me - and I found that I loved the freedom of it! Instead of feeling constrained by the pencil lines, I was \"free\" to paint directly, loosely, using vibrant colours, which resulted in more lively work. Sofia usually adds meticulous pen and ink details to her work. I left mine as they were; as I may have mentioned before I have rather limited patience!\\nThere is always a certain amount of fear involved in painting this way. I had to learn to be brave, to trust that the colours I was choosing and the marks I was making were strong and true and confident. This was no time for fiddling around with details and tentative marks. Before I started, I would look carefully at the veg, get a feel for the overall shape and size and proportions, the main colours, the shadows on the paper. Really look, and get a feel for it. It helped to stand up, to have everything I needed to hand and to just do it, quickly. I love this way of working; writing this makes me want to do some more of this kind of work.\\nSome of my veg paintings are available as digital downloads from my Etsy shop.\\nVarious items (prints, mugs, phone covers, tote bags etc.) sporting my veg paintings can also be found on Redbubble.\\nI often make soup. At the organic veg farm where I work part-time, we take it in turns to bring a pot of soup to the veg shed on the day we pack veg bags for customers. One of the things I love about soup is that it is very forgiving. You can throw just about anything into it and it is usually pretty tasty and good. (The only exception seems to be kiwi fruit, which a friend reminded me of today - that did not turn out well. I do quite often put apple or pear in soup though, lends a lovely sweetness). Most of us who takes turns with the soup pot admit to making \"bottom of the fridge\" soup, with whatever is left and is maybe looking a little tired. Some celery, onion, a courgette, a bit of broccoli, the odd kale leaf and some carrots - add ham stock, a tin of chopped tomatoes and hey presto, it\\'s minestrone! Minestrone is one of my favourites and yet I don\\'t recall having it at home when I was a child. We had broth (not a favourite; I disliked the gloopy texture of the barley), and homemade tomato soup with lots of carrots and was it sago, perhaps, to thicken it? My favourite was cucumber soup, creamy and buttery and delicious. My dad loved consomme, hot or cold (brown meaty jelly with chopped chives on top). We had chicken soup too, made using a boiling fowl, with rice and leeks and chopped parsley from the garden to garnish it. We used to laugh at Mum, who would make soup from the peapods after the sweet garden peas had been shelled from them. \"Is that grass soup?\" we would ask. I quite often produce \"green soup\" of slightly dubious origins myself, these days, so I can now appreciate the greenness of her ways.\\nIt\\'s a real comfort food. And not just the eating of it, or supping of it, but the act of making it. I remember retreating to the kitchen of my mother-in-law\\'s house the day after my father-in-law died very suddenly, over 25 years ago now. We went to stay with her, with our six month old son. To try to help; to organise the funeral, make endless cups of tea for people who came in to offer condolences; to try and make sense of it all. All I could do was make soup. I chopped and stirred and added stock. I left it to simmer, tasted it, ladled it into bowls for whoever wanted some. It seemed to help. It helped me, to feel I was providing comfort, of sorts. I think I maybe even baked. There was comfort in it for me too. Just the rhythm of washing and peeling and chopping, stirring and tasting and serving.

Wrigley’s Extra Sugar-Free Gum wanted to inspire Chinese parents to encourage their children to chew sugar-free gum after meals, which can help prevent tooth decay and improve oral health.\\nWe tapped into Chinese school children’s daily lunch routines and created the first interactive lunchbox that encourages children to practice oral hygiene after meals — Extra Care Box.

Pictures of updo hairstyles.\\nAre you looking at a more sophisticated hair updo style for your wedding or prom? If so, we have a great collection of examples that will help you find the right look. Our examples focus on women who have somewhat longer hair that can be used in dramatic fashion. Here you will find a number of updo hairstyles from those close to casual to others that push the boundaries and make an unforgettable impression. The first row of examples is highlighted by the third photo which features a complicated pinned up style, yet has enough play to make it attractive. The second photo is a great example of how bangs can be used to really highlight the face while still having the rest of the hair updo pinned back. Naturally, augmenting your hair with natural decorations such as flowers can make for a great way to set your style apart. In the second row we see more classic examples of sophisticated wedding and prom updo styles. While the first example is perfect for those with very curly hair, the third and fourth are pure classic updo’s perfect for more formal occasions. If you have long, thick hair, then you might want to try the example in the second photo to highlight your face. The third row is a great combination of pulled back styles along with loose, more casual feel. The second example does require some work and spray, but the results are perfect for weddings. For younger women, especially those attending the prom the first and fourth photos provide excellent examples of what can be done. For the final row we have another combination of both casual and pinned up hair that you can choose from when attending the wedding or prom. In particular, the third photo shows a dramatic style indeed.\\nPortfolio 3 showcases delicate up-dos mainly for long straight hair. Picture number 1 and 2 are beautiful examples of straightforward updo’s incorporating hair accessories that are fit for the most magnificent wedding. Picture number 10 is a gorgeous and sophisticated low chignon with the hair neatly pinned back away from the face.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-24T14:27:44Z', 'url': 'http://www.just-hairstyles.com/prom-hairstyles.htm'}\n","{'text': 'MARIKINA CITY – The Marikina City council is celebrating the Christmas season focusing on the city’s rich culture and heritage, its growing shoe and food industries, as well as the contributions of the family in its growth and development over the last three centuries.\\n“Founded nearly 400 years ago, Marikina City has weathered a number of challenges, thanks to the strength and the unity of its people – those who were originally from Marikina and those who decided to settle here and found kinship with the locals (or “taal na Marikeño” in Filipino),” the local government said in a statement.\\nThe significance of unity will take the center stage in these festivals.\\nDubbed as Experience Marikina, the local government has lined up numerous activities to celebrate its three major festivals in the last two months of the year: the Sapatos Festival, the Rehiyon, Rehiyon, and the Christmas Festival.\\nThe city will also commemorate the 22nd year since it became a chartered city on December 8, 1996.\\n“United ang theme ng celebrations ng mga festival sa Marikina.

So I started googling to see if there was any challenges already out there that did what I was looking for. A few that I found wasn't really what I was looking for. I wanted to also create all the rabbit hole lots along with the residential lots with out having to move into each house and leave other sims behind. I didn't want to have to repopulate the whole town with just my sim either so I decided to create my own. So here is what I have come up with so far.\\nI was requested to write down the rules for this challenge so here are the challenge rules!\\nYour sim has come from an over crowded town with lots of noise and pollution. They have traveled far away from any civilization and has settled here to start over from scratch. This area has no buildings, no houses and no residents. This is a great place for your sim to start over in life and build everything from scratch from the ground up.\\nPick any world you like and go into Edit Town and delete every house and building. This includes any rabbit holes.\\nPick your sim either by creating new or a preexisting one.\\nYour lifespan can be what ever you want, I suggest a long one. I'm using a fairy so I have a very long life span.\\nYour sim will not have a job to start out with so you will need to make money in other ways like fishing, searching for flowers or gems to sell.\\nOnce your sim has some money you can do other things to make money as well like painting, photography, writing for example.\\nOnce some job buildings are placed you can have your sim have a job along with previous mentions of money making activities.\\nYour sim can buy properties or become business owners to make money as well.\\n~When you build the house to rent, you don't need to build with your own money otherwise your sim will end up spending double the cost. Build the house then go in and have your sim rent it out.\\n~Once a residential lot has been created for a certain category, you can add to it later as long as it doesn't take it out of it's original category; for example: a starter home changing to a family home.\\nThere can be NO residents living in the town until there is a house sufficient enough for them to live.\\nFor example: must have fridge, toilet, bed and shower/tub along with all flooring and wallpapers in the home as well.\\nOnce there is a place for a sim to move in, you can move any sim in you want or an immigrant can move in. No Immigrants are aloud to move into any empty lots so make sure they are all set to no visitors until a residential lot is built.\\nAll community and residential lots must be built by your sim.\\nAll Parks must be built by your sim.\\nAll active job's that need a building need to be built by your sim.\\nYour sim can have any personal life you choose. Once there are residents living in your town, your sim can date, get married, have children or your sim can live alone for their entire life. However you choose.\\nAny community lot can be combined with another community lot. For example, a tattoo parlor can be built with a salon. More than two can be built together which comes in handy when your not working with very many lots in the world or it's a small island. If you do not have an expansion pack that has one of the requirement builds listed above that is okay.\\nYou can only fail the challenge if one thing were to happen, your sim dies before the above requirements are met.\\nThere is a possibility of any of these rules changing as I go along in my video series as I have not tested out this challenge. Any ideas or suggestions or if I missed anything in the rules are welcome!\\nLet me know how this challenge is going for you!\\nI started a game similar to this and had to place a few community lots and my town's main library has a city hall rabbit hole rug for editing the chances of alien abductions resulting in pregnancies.I placed skill requiremnents for aditional building and they also have to build their house first before any other buildings get built in edit town.I also did require lots for new families to have a mailbox,trash bin. wall section,burglar alarm,fire alarm,sleeping bags and laptop computers though cheap ones.The founders have to get a house built before winter arrives and survive their first winter before adding to their house and they also have to start growing plants on their lot before the second winter and new families could begin arriving the following year in late spring or early summer.I allow chess tables and martial arts equipment to start showing up after a second household is in town.Building is based on donations on community lots or taxes collected from incomes.\\nI made a change in the rules when it comes to building the house you want to rent out to your town.\", 'timestamp': '2019-04-22T16:50:04Z', 'url': 'http://qbaliki.modthesims.info/showthread.php?t=617825'}\n","{'text': 'Open to adults & teens.

I'd expect to see Labour in the mid to high 40s, National in the mid to low 40s, and the Greens and New Zealand First struggling to reach 5 per cent.\\nThe main reason for this is that Ardern hasn't been personally responsible for many of the issues that have played out and, where she has, they've mostly been on things that I don't think are necessarily going to sway voters. That, combined with her personal popularity, will mean that while Ardern has burnt some political capital fighting fires, she still has a deep well of support to call on.\\nThe Labour Party's seemingly terrible handling of the sexual assaults at the Waihi camp will reflect badly on Labour's General Secretary Andrew Kirton, but as Ardern was only briefly at the camp delivering a speech, and had nothing to do with its organisation or the events in question, I doubt any voters will hold her responsible for it. A test may come further down the line when Labour's own internal investigation is complete if it finds significant failings on the part of the party organisation and Ardern doesn't demand that someone takes personal responsibility, but that's hard to preempt given there's a lot of water to go under the bridge.\\nThe Russia fiasco - Winston Peters' alternative facts on Russian interference with the US election and Russian involvement in the downing of MH17, the bizarre focus of Peters on a Russian free trade deal, and the ham-fisted attempt by the Government to first condemn the Salisbury attack without blaming Russia, then several days later finally managing to step into line with our allies and blame Russia, as well as Ardern's bungled attempts to spin away that foreign policy disaster - while a bad look generally for Ardern and Peters, isn't the type of issue that will sway votes, even if it has lead to some questioning within the beltway of Ardern's own judgement and Peters' motives.\\nWhat has been interesting is that the Russia saga played out over 11 days. If a day is a long time in politics, then 11 days is an eternity for an issue like this to run its initial course. There's possibly more to come in this space, which could start to erode voter confidence in the Government's foreign policy and security credentials.\\nRon Mark's defence force flights and Jenny Salesa's ministerial spending are similarly both minor issues. In the bigger scheme of things both are relatively minor issues. While Mark hasn't handled the pressure being questioned about the flights put him under particularly well, Ardern did the requisite telling off of Salesa and unless it becomes a pattern of overspend, the matter will rest there.\\nOne thing that will nag at Labour's recovery of support in the regions, at least in the top of the South Island, has been the Government's sluggish response to Cyclone Gita in Nelson and Tasman. It took nearly three weeks after Cyclone Gita hit New Zealand for the Government to announce any meaningful assistance for businesses cut off by the storm. And unlike the flooding in Edgecumbe, which prompted a Prime Ministerial visit from Bill English to see first hand what had unfolded, the residents of Takaka and the surrounding areas still haven't seen or heard from Ardern.\\nNot that anyone is suggesting a Prime Minister visiting is somehow going to magically undo the damage done by a given disaster, but it usually serves as both a way to boost morale in the affected communities, as well as to highlight the ongoing importance of the recovery to Government agencies to ensure they keep their efforts up.\\nThe Green Party surprising everyone by gifting questions in Question Time to National has been an interesting issue to follow the reaction to. While it feeds the Opposition's narrative that not all is well and cozy on the Government benches, any consequential reaction to it seems to be more directed at the Green Party over it, both supportive of the move and in opposition to it. While headlines of the Greens doing a deal with National aren't helpful to Labour, it seems unlikely this will translate into the polls either.\\nFinally, there was Shane Jones' attack on Air New Zealand. It kicked off on Friday and didn't end until Ardern finally hauled Jones back into line during Question Time on Wednesday. Jones' comments caused some concern in both the beltway and business community, as did Ardern's initial backing of Jones. Outside of the beltway, Jones' comments will have played well.\\nTowards the end of the past two weeks Ardern was getting visibly frustrated with both media questioning and Opposition attacks. In part this will stem from this being the first time her Government has been hauled over the coals for a significant length of time. But no doubt a lot of her annoyance will come from the fact that most of the problems she's been having to deal with aren't ones that she's been responsible for, barring her poor handling of the Russia issue.\\nThe rough patch is set to continue too. With the Select Committee submissions soon to be heard on the Electoral Integrity Amendment Bill, there will be a stream of negative headlines about the Government pushing that Bill through, as well as the Green Party's support for it. There's also lingering questions around Winston Peters' infatuation with Putin's Russia.\\nIt shouldn't escape anyone's notice that New Zealand First, who are struggling badly in polls, have been the source of three of the issues that have dogged the Government in the past two weeks. Shane Jones' comments are perhaps the most interesting in this regard, as they point towards New Zealand First taking a much more vocal stand on issues that might not always sit well with the responsibilities and requirements of occupying the Government benches.\\nThe good news for Labour is that with Easter fast approaching, and beyond that the beginning of pre-Budget announcements, the Government does have an opportunity to start setting the news agenda rather than reacting to it.\", 'timestamp': '2019-04-18T13:07:11Z', 'url': 'https://www.libertas.digital/blog/tag/Ron+Mark'}\n","{'text': 'Are you thinking of organizing a special day with your friends?

Alternating between hot and cold with one sock halfway off I am dreaming and tossing about, waking occasionally to feebly reach for water or a lymphatic tincture.\\nIt’s a fever dream, and I’m giving my body space to heal itself. After getting the un-fabulous advice, at a party, that “sudafed and benadryl are good for sinus infections” I find myself musing on what we—mothers, healers, our culture–have given up. If we pop a sudafed-tm-every time we fall ill we are denying ourselves the opportunity to build our OWN knowledge about the human body. This fever is giving me information about myself. It is giving me words and phrases, showing me my fears and my strengths.\\nI believe that it is part of life to fall ill, to feel our blood ice up and our brain catch fire. How else can we know what is possible? How can sudafed teach us what healing means?\\nAnd every time I hear folks ask me what they can do to avoid illness I tell them that illness is an opportunity. Some of my favorite healers are seekers who see illness as a learning experience. Our wisdom is hard-won and comes from hands-on experience which sometimes gets messy. Illness teaches us how to support healing, how to get out of the way of healing, and puts the knowledge and the feeling into our own hands, puts the power into us. Popping wal-mart echinacea pills every day is a suppressive technique. Taking unnecessary medications (natural or pharmaceutical) to suppress symptoms is not “healing”.\\nI find my best healing comes from movement. Moving the lymphatics, moving mucous, moving stuck energy, activating digestion. Allowing the fever to do its’ job inside of us.\\nBecause all of life is a learning opportunity. Hot weather is an opportunity to feel hot. Cold weather is an opportunity to feel cold. Discomfort is a gift which gives us the chance to learn what tools we have, as humans, to help ourselves and to support our bodies’ natural processes. We are so eager to dry humidity and make ice less slippery that we never understand what humidity feels like, or what slippery really means. We do not KNOW hot or cold. We do not SEEK to know.\\nThe way that we are giving our own power away harms us, and our children too. It rewards people and corporations who will give us comfort at any cost. Those who can learn to accept some basic discomfort as a normal part of life will be prepared for whatever may happen. Allowing our children to feel a fever’s heat and chills is a gift which teaches them not to fear their bodies.\\nIt is my wish to ride my fever like a surfer, accepting the fear, facing the mortality of my body. Because more so than those without fear, it is those who feel the fear then do it anyway who build power and wisdom. Neither sudafed nor benadryl will give a speck of wisdom or empowerment to us, and they will never teach us about our bodies capacity to heal itself.\\nNOTE: this was scriblled on my bedsite notebook during a fever. if that is what YOU consider “medical advice”, fine. however, it should be clear that i do NOT intend this to be medical advice!!!!!!!!\\nNICE nice article!

For comparison, in industrial systems the potential savings range between 30% and 40%. In the aquarium world, dealing with a delicate organic process in which parameters can change, good results should also be expected. A large amount of the energy is consumed by pumps. Therefore a first logical step for energy saving lies in determining the pumps duty point(s). Pumps are the backbone of the aquarium, creating the needed water movement in the exhibits and feeding the LSS. The pumps’ delivery head must be enough to over-come all resistance losses caused by pipe work, appendages, protein skimmer, sand filters and so on. During pump selection safety margins are added in ensure that flow required in the design is realised. Nowadays, for getting flexibility in pump performance and to avoid throttling of the system, the use of variable frequency drive (VFD) is widely used. However, the use of VFD can have unexpected effects on the LSS system. When pumps deviates more to the right of their Best Efficiency Point (BEP), the grade of efficiency can decrease and Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) will diminish, giving way to higher risks of vibration (including cavitation) and noise. Then, mechanical pump load will increase, speeding up the maintenance frequency, causing more down time of the LSS which will have an impact on the controllability of the LSS. In addition, pipe work and its components will face more mechanical impact, increasing the risk of cracking pipes, giving way to failures like super-saturation.\\nThere are a number of factors to consider when planning a new aquarium facility. One of the most important factors to consider is how will aquarium seawater will be supplied? Most inland facilities are obligated to make their own saltwater, but facilities located adjacent to natural seawater sources must evaluate collecting a continuous source of water. A source of good quality natural seawater can have a long term impact on operational cost as well as provide benefits to animal health. Important aspects to consider in the planning for a seawater intake for an aquarium facility are as follows: Where will the intake be located? The geographical location of the intake impacts the overall water quality that the intake will deliver. Things to consider include land based activities or industries, maritime traffic and freshwater intrusion sources such as natural stream beds or high capacity storm drains. Local and seasonal currents as well as tidal swings will also have an impact on the seawater intake location. What type of intake would be appropriate for the facility? There are number of different ways to intake seawater for use at an aquarium facility. This includes sea floor pipelines, pier based pump stations, land based pump stations, seawater wells and rainy collectors. Different methods and examples of facilities using similar methods will be discussed. Logistics, capital costs and long term operational costs all play a role in the method selected. What is the water quality of the source water? Is it suitable for use in the Aquarium facility? The seawater quality for any intake will vary by season and by day depending on a number of different things. Seasonal water quality samples can help the decision making process in regard to suitability and the treatment regime required. Water bodies that are high in pollutants may not be acceptable for use in the aquarium, forcing a seaside facility to manufacture seawater or obtain good quality seawater in other ways such as by truck or barge. Regulatory requirements will impact both the seawater intake and the discharge facilities. Local regulatory agency requirements vary from location to location and fall under the umbrella of national regulations as well. Discharge regulations focus on water quality parameters such as concentrations of oxidants, suspended solids, BOD and bacteria counts. At times discharge water quality parameters are lower than the water quality that you may see at the seawater intake itself. Chloride limits by local sewer agencies can also come into play in facility planning.\\nDuring a recent renovation, the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Center (VAMSC) installed a District Energy System or DES for short. VAMSC is one of only a few institutions in British Columbia to integrate such an innovative system to manage energy use. VAMSC follows LEED and ISO 14001 construction practices and in 2015 was awarded the Green Award by AZA in part due to the implementation of the District Energy System. The DES is a site wide low grade energy loop that extracts or rejects energy through a variety of sources. Heat producing equipment such as chillers and food service refrigeration reject heat in to the loop through liquid cooled condensers. Isolated water and glycol systems are circulated using variable speed pumps to move energy around the system. Heat is extracted through heat exchangers to warm habitats, galleries and coils in local HVAC air handlers. Cooling is accomplished in the same way using the cold side of the system. Temperatures in the loop are maintained in a specified range using seawater heat exchangers, boilers, heat pumps and a cooling tower. Planning is underway to install a geothermal field to store excess heat produced in warmer months for use in the winter. The net effect is that heating and cooling costs can be reduced since it requires much less energy to redistribute the energy than it would to produce it at multiple points of use.\\nLife support system instrumentation indicates equipment function, but it is water quality parameters that indicate equipment efficacy and resource allocation that indicates equipment efficiency. Equipment parameters—pressure, flow, water level, etc.—can be operating within “design specifications”, yet water quality parameters (e.g., nutrients, alkalinity, pH) can be unsuitable for aquatic life and/or excess resources (e.g., water, energy, labor) must be expended to normalize the environment. In the past, available technologies were not able to address the demands of a healthy closed aquarium habitat without eventual recourse to substantial water exchanges to normalize the environment. This situation no longer prevails. Dissolved contaminants can now be physically removed from solution by ozone-assisted foam fractionation, a widely accepted industry standard in the modern era. Nitrite accumulation can be managed with recently-developed and user-friendly denitrification technologies. Phosphates can be controlled with modern water treatment tools and pH decline can be addressed via well-designed gas exchangers to ameliorate CO2 accumulation from animal and bacterial respiration, and the degradation of wastes and uneaten food. Given these relatively recent advances, it is clear that water quality challenges in a modern aquarium have their root causes tied to incomplete life support system design and/or inappropriate system operation. By ensuring that life support systems are well designed and operated appropriately, optimal water quality can result and excess resource expenditure can be avoided, consistent with the conservation and fiscal priorities for the modern zoo and aquarium.\\nPressured by the rapid pace of climate change and ocean acidification, aquariums are feeling an increased urgency to provide a message of conservation and sustainability to their visitors. Research shows that people are more receptive to this message when presented with concrete evidence of how their actions can create positive change. As such, aquariums have a stronger incentive than ever to lead by example, reducing their demands for energy and freshwater. Traditional aquarium life support systems have been very energy and freshwater use intensive, primarily due to pump energy, heating and cooling demands and use of water for backwashing of filters. Such systems can easily account for more than 50% of the energy and water use of a facility. But opportunities to reduce energy and water use with such systems are minimal without unacceptable reductions in water quality. However, innovative system design alternatives are being included in new aquariums and renovations. These incorporate drum filtration, which can drastically reduce energy and water use over traditional pressurized filtration systems. Additional strategies, such as integration of life support heating and cooling into energy efficient building mechanical systems introduce the potential for further energy reductions. Such systems are most effective when system elements are arranged so that gravity flow replaces a significant amount of pumping. While capital costs of such systems may be somewhat higher than traditional systems, life cycle cost analysis can be used to demonstrate that substantial energy and water savings and reduced equipment maintenance and replacement costs can easily offset the initial cost premium of such a system. By pushing the design of our future facilities, aquariums can lead by example as they strive to increase the impact of conservation education on their visitors.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-19T17:14:19Z', 'url': 'https://www.animalprofessional.com/iac-2016-life-support-operations-abstracts.html'}\n","{'text': 'What’s wrong with this sentence?

We believe we will be changing the face of fitness.\\nIs it a boot strapped venture or you raised funds from the market?\\nThis is a 100 per cent self-funded venture.\\nWhat’s the current geographical presence of MultiFit? Why not entered in northern region as yet? Or if you did, why not expanding aggressively?\\nWe want to reach out to places where there is a dearth of fitness.

Any new outlet to open in near future? Which potential area in Indian market is still untouched and why?\\nWe plan to have 30 branches by Dec 2017. Karadi (Pune) and Gurgaon are two clubs going live in the next fortnight. The new markets in India being Bangalore, Indore, Mumbai and two tier II cities.\\nIndia as a country is a completely untapped market. 99 per cent of the country is Untapped. Currently 60per cent of India’s population is under 30 years of age and it’s growing steadily at 8per cent p.a. Out of 80 million middle class households, 55 million (69 per cent) reside in tier II and tier III cities which accounts for 70per cent of total consumption in India. This is the Real India with new dreams, aspirations, wants, and needs. The future of health and fitness is immense and will be driven by this emerging new India.\\nDo you feel rapidly growing fitness aggregators of FitTech are big threats to entrepreneurs like you who are most dominating the market through physical presence?\\nNot at all, I think they are only creating more awareness of the Industry and will only be helping players like ours. Physical gyms will always stay, we are talking physical activity, it’s like saying one can learn swimming online. Not happening. People may workout on their own, but man is a social animal, working out with people keeps one motivated and it’s the sheer energy which becomes an addiction.

The destination was in Chile, but the weather was not so bad even when the plane touched the sky from Uruguay. After that, the jet jumped heavily in the air, when it was calm to hit the hill and hit it in the other side, many of the 40 people had died in the death country and the rest of them were busy playing the last game with sure death. One of them was Petro Alguta. The crowd of dead bodies lay down all around. There are many human bodies in the same way that they are covered in rice. They did not even die, have survived. But nobody knows how long it can be possible to survive in the cold. Petro\\'s the same condition. The next passenger was dead soon. Petro has gone out of the broken door by removing the dead bodies, along with a few others.\\nIn the question what would happen, a passenger suddenly lit torch of light, He said, \"Do not worry, the news of the crash of the plane has reached Chile, from where the rescue team came. After several days have passed, no one is seen. Meanwhile, a few more people have died in the blaze. Then a few young people survived but then he fought with death, but again, how did this situation go away? Meanwhile, the coolness of the cold is rising, the cutting of the wind is blowing like a carrot but no one has left the cold, no one will survive, but death is sure. Meanwhile, the man\\'s food and the last tension of the water quickly burnt down in the face. No one can survive the end of the meal. Without food, it is impossible to survive in this cold if there is no magic. Meanwhile, Petro looked at a glimpse of the clock and 13 days had passed but no one else was seen.\\nThey are forgetting the rest of the world, so no one is coming to save them. Then everyone decides to live if they have to eat and if there is no food then dead friends are the only hope. The first was vomited, most of the people then started eating meat of man like a madman, and then they started eating meat. Petro\\'s fate was a friend\\'s cut hand and thighs. Petro was biting his bite. On the day that the people became angry they became a monster. About 25 years after that terrible experience, Petro wrote a book named in to the Mountain. He gave a detailed account of that time. He wrote today and when I look at that day, if I did not do that work then maybe I could not see today\\'s day.\\nThink of what a terrible experience is that a group of civilized man eats their Fellow traveler to save lives. In fact, the people who were killed were not forced to eat meat in the day that they were killed, but see that many people are alive today because of the dead people. Petro Alguata is one of them. Petro said from her own experience that on the day nobody was thinking that they were eating meat but everyone thought that friends had saved them even after. Thus, after a whole 72 days, finally a rescue team comes; they come alive to 16 people. These 16 people, who were living under that mountain, ice, and humankind, were the miracles. All of the dead did not die in the crash; many were killed due to severe cold and lack of food. It is also said that there are murders in order to survive because all the people suspected that due to food, there was a condition in the absence of food that anyone could wait for the dead body. When there is a high level of food, it is also common to kill any living person and it has happened to food.

Here are a list of the top reasons to consider it even if your business is not based in Nevada.\\nNevada Protects the Corporate Veil.\\nNevada offers it’s corporations great protection for its board of directors, even if you are the only member on the board and own all of the shares. In the last 24 years the Nevada courts have only allowed the corporate veil to be pierced twice, and both were for outright fraud cases. In comparison, one out of very two cases in California.\\nNevada does not exchange information with the IRS.\\nThe only other state to do this is Texas. Keep in mind that if you must register your corporation in another state, the state laws there will apply.\\nCurrently the filing fees with Nevada are $125.\\nNevada offers protection of Board of Directors from shareholder lawsuits.\\nThe shareholders must prove gross negligence in order to find the Board of Directors liable. And to prove gross negligence is to pierce the corporate veil in Nevada.\\nIn Nevada, you must only have a legal purpose to form a corporation or LLC.\\nMeaning, a person could form a Nevada LLC to hold personal assets. It is not required that the LLC have a business purpose to form.\\nThere is no joint and several liabilities.\\nThis means that if a judgment is entered against several defendants, they will each assume equal liability for the full amount of the judgment, regardless of their relative fault in causing the problem. In Nevada, courts are required to assign a percentage of faults to each defendant. And each defendant is only liable for their percentage.\\nOne person can hold all of the corporate positions.\\nNevada Protects the Board of Directors and Officers.\\nIn 1987, Nevada passed a law permitting corporations to place their own provisions in their Articles of Incorporation that can eliminate the personal liablity of the officers and directors to the stockholders.

This is a simple, human truth: As mammals, we are driven by a desire to bond with others, feel accepted, and be acknowledged for a job well done. In fact, research from the University of Iowa shows that feeling accepted is more motivating than even financial incentives and improves our productivity and performance. But there’s a difference between wanting and needing others’ approval.\\nIf, for example, you find yourself obsessing over the number of “likes” you get on social media or forever waiting for your supervisor or coworkers to notice that you’ve done something well, you might be caught in a toxic cycle of approval addiction.\\nApproval addiction is a constant need for acceptance and approval that drives your daily actions to the detriment of your own needs, says Lynn Taylor, author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior & Thrive in Your Job.\\nApproval addicts usually wind up worn out and disappointed, adds psychologist Linda Sapadin, author of Master Your Fears: How to Triumph Over Your Worries and Get On With Your Life. They spend so much energy seeking positive feedback that they have less energy to take care of themselves or work toward their meaningful goals. And, Taylor says, constantly seeking approval can cause people to become workaholics, suffer health problems, and make choices that result in less-than-ideal consequences.\\nThe first step is to build awareness and adjust your priorities accordingly. To begin, ask yourself some tough questions. What are your primary goals? What do you want to do? Then evaluate how you spend your time: Are you neglecting your dreams by doing too much for others? With this awareness, you can deliberately choose activities that support your own needs, Taylor says, and step out of the people-pleasing cycle.\\nUse the insights gleaned from your personal audit to establish some ground rules and boundaries for yourself. Spend more time on the things that leave you feeling positive and focused on your dreams, needs, and values. Say “yes” to the tasks and activities that align with those goals—and don’t be afraid to say, “No, but thanks for thinking of me,” to those that don’t, Sapadin adds. These guidelines will help you manage your time and energy in a way that leaves plenty left over to help others if you choose.\\n“If your objective is to set your own standards and appreciate your accomplishments and self-worth, you can be 100 percent successful,” Sapadin says. “You can set realistic goals and monitor them based on your own criteria.” And that goes a long way to building not only a sense of self-worth, but a sense of self-efficacy (the belief that you are capable of solving a task or problem), resilience, and even purpose. You can have that right now—and you don’t need anyone’s approval to get it.\\nPolly Campbell has been speaking and writing about psychology, resilience, and wellness topics for more than 20 years.

We are dedicated to personalized, proactive, effective and resourceful planning that protects clients and their assets during their lifetime and efficiently distributes assets to beneficiaries at death.\\nEstate planning is deceptively complex; it is tempting to ‘do it yourself’. After all, almost everyone knows about a power of attorney and a will. Unfortunately, there are many ways for a plan to go terribly wrong. In some situations, no plan at all is effective. Other times, no plan, or incomplete and faulty planning brings needless financial and emotional hardship to loved ones.\\nDo you know the factors in your life that make estate planning, or lack of planning, vulnerable to disaster?\\nBelow is a story of heartbreak, financial difficulty or family disruption that could have been avoided with effective planning. The story is real; with changes to protect confidentiality. It’s one of many stories highlighting ways a good plan can go wrong, the perils of not planning at all, the danger in do-it-yourself, and Buyer Beware if you don’t use an estate planning attorney.\\nHusband and Wife (“Harry” and “Wilma”) had been married for over 30 years. Harry died unexpectedly, in middle of real estate sale. The real estate broker, the buyer, and Wilma were surprised to find out Harry was the only listed owner on the Deed. The real estate agent called our office to help. We were able to scramble, avoid a probate, and get the property in Wilma’s name. In this case, it worked because Harry and Wilma had acquired the property during their marriage and she could swear until penalty of perjury, that the property was community property.\\nWilma vowed to develop her own estate plan so that her three children would not have any hassles at her death. She met with me on several occasions and we talked about it a lot. She knew how she wanted her estate divided: one child needed to inherit her home, even though this meant the others would not have an equal share. The other two didn’t ‘need’ the home and were not in a position to take care of Wilma’s many animals on the property. She worried that the distribution would be unequal because there were insufficient other assets to balance out the gift of the home.\\nThe primary worry that kept her from making the plan was how one child would react. We discussed her options and she accepted that it was her decision to make, but she just didn’t want to confront the unresolved issue with a child. She went into the hospital for a little bout of something and never came home. One daughter continued to pay property taxes, keep the home up and care for the animals until her money ran out.\\nSince Wilma had never signed her estate plan, she was intestate; the Probate Code determines what happens to a person’s assets when they don’t leave a will. In this case, all three children shared equally in the estate, which meant the house was sold. The relationship among the siblings rapidly deteriorated and will not likely be repaired. It was not what Wilma wanted and her family is paying the price; it is really heartbreaking.\\nDo you understand your estate plan? Do you know the factors in your life that make estate planning, or lack of planning, vulnerable to disaster?\\nGive the attorneys at Hyatt McIntire & Associates* a call; we are problem solvers and believe the best solution is to be proactive.

Juggling time between a marketing job and golf courts, he took good care of his health to maintain his busy lifestyle. But in May 2015, Palov experienced two weeks of chest pains. Following a visit with a cardiologist at the Lakeshore Hospital he knew his lifestyle was about to change.\\nThe angiogram was very clear: Palov had extensive blockage in his arteries (85 to 90 per cent) and needed to undergo surgery as soon as possible.\\nIt was Dr. Patrick Ergina, cardiac surgeon at the RVH-MUHC, who treated Palov. “Mr. Palov came to the MUHC because he needed an Aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass surgery,” he explains.\\nDr. Ergina’s mission was to help restore the blood flow to Palov’s heart by replacing the blocked aortic valve with a new prosthetic valve and by bypassing the blocked coronary arteries with vessels that were taken from his legs.\\nRaji Cambow was one of Palov’s physiotherapists during his stay at the MUHC. As part of the unit’s multidisciplinary team, Cambow’s main role consists of helping patients gain back their mobility after a cardiac surgery.\\nIn fact, this first experience at the newly located Royal Victoria Hospital left nothing but good impressions on Palov who made sure to send a letter of appreciation to the MUHC upon his discharge from the hospital.\\nFront row: Veronique Tardif, Dr. Patrick Ergina; back row: Linda Lowe, Susan Lloy, Raj Cambow, Donna Patterson, Maryam Ahli Eraghi, Myriam Julien, Christine Lefebvre.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-22T12:28:44Z', 'url': 'https://muhc.ca/our-stories/article/enjoying-life-after-heart-surgery'}\n","{'text': 'My writing routine begins with a walk outdoors. Not a long walk or a fast one. Two miles up the street and back, early in the morning in summer before our California sun blisters the city, or before rain turns a winter walk into a slog. Most mornings it’s a walk on the shady side of the street, a familiar trek that doesn’t require me to think about where to turn or when to start ambling back home.\\nI’m lucky if I can get going without returning for one last thing, like replacing the house phone for my cell, realizing I’m not wearing my contacts, trading stiff shoes for a more comfortable pair, one more trip to bathroom, another smear of sunblock. Once I’m finally on my way, it’s a slight uphill hike and a reverse easy jaunt down.\\nA walk is a great opportunity to get a bit of exercise, because I will never wear those dorky rubber band outfits I’d have to don to go to a gym. I work out problems, even if I don’t work up much of a sweat, like the chronic situations that give me nightmares if I sleep in too late. I worry about personal problems, because as much as I’m fortunate to have loving family and friends, there is always someone to worry about. I worry about the injustices of my employment, politically inspired office intrigue affecting even my paltry claim to the working world. The walk uphill gives me a chance to excise those devils, though they’ll return like persistent hiccups. I walk more and more determinedly, relinquishing the pain in my calves for concentration on those cerebral irritants. Most days I realize there is little I can do except let go my worry, anger, and frustration, so I do, resolution of sorts.\\nAt the top of the rise my palm swings around the light post that signals my walk homeward, and I begin to write. I work in my head because I can’t walk with a laptop though I’ve considered it. Some of my effort will get lost on the way home, but I’ll retain the essence of my work.\\nI hunt when I walk. I am a bird of prey. I seek words and pluck them before they scurry to safety. I stash interesting words that say things other than boring things like thing, (could you be more specific?) or stuff, (could you please be more specific?) or place (oh come on now.) Words come inspired by the crack of brittle tree limb, a flash of sunlight tagging a flag on a house balcony, the blap of a horn as a car zips by. Sensory imprints cast words like paladin (I want one of them for my very own, with sword or without), bleat (the sound of losers whining or of animals trapped in tales about Cyclopic pigs with batwings), contrafactum (just hum along here). I cache words for late night writing snacks.\\nThen I’m on to phrases, collections of words strung in movable pieces like frig magnets, passages whizzing around pesky as gnats. Found this one after passing an odorous clump left by someone who owns a dog but “forgot” the blue plastic baggie: “a dapple of sunlight tapping shadows on the ground, the only beauty in this muck.” Technically the dog left it, but you know what I mean. This next phrase is a bit of a cheat as I discovered it after falling into the cul de sac trying to remove a stubbornly rooted weed, minutes after completing my walk: “I see myself as a force of nature but a submissive one.” Maybe this one is usable: “Why is it that when a thing drops, it always slides under a cabinet so massive and low-grounded that you can’t reach it without a backhoe?” Cheating again, a complete sentence but not a profound one. The idea came after the pretty stone I wanted to keep dropped and rolled under a tangle of weeds, lost forever. How many unidentifiable clumps did I want to turn over?\\nFinally it’s the serious stuff I’m gathering. Like the sight of the lady who used to push a baby stroller done up in hot pink tiger stripes with sequined bows on the sun awning. A close look revealed it wasn’t her child she was pushing. Well, not her human child, anyway. It was a shih-tzu-oodle-hua, one of those toy pooches bred not for walking or running like other wild critters, but a little fluff of squeaks to salve a lonely soul who doesn’t have a hope of having grandchildren. And then my pity rolls out, because as awful as I find the tawdry contraption in which the yapper rides, I also respond to the woman’s isolation, so removed from the world that she can best communicate with a mini dog that can’t talk. Or walk.\\nThe sensations, images, and words I’ve collected on my walk will show up in my writing. I’ll bring them to the front when I need to feel an activity in my gut, when I want to describe something with authentic detail. I’ll twist, tweak, and change elements to suit, but they’ll end up in some story. The best walks deliver the opening to writing gridlock that’s kept me scribbling drivel for the last day or two. Engaged with story, I’ll delete crap, write passages, correct problems, or know how to get my main character rolling off the sofa to make a decisive move in my WIP.\\nBack home in an hour, I’ve worked off 27 calories, 32 if I’ve walked fast, a paltry effort at improving my health. But I’ve started to write and can hardly wait to get on the computer. That’s my routine, odd as it is. For me it works. Let me know what works for you.\\nBecause if you don’t, why should anyone else?

Great question. There’s probably an official answer but honestly to me they’re the same thing. The only difference is the type of pan you make it in.

So whether you want to call this a pie or a tart, I’m ok with either.\\nI took this to a potluck and I think I called it a pie.

I’m ok with fancy business, but let’s be honest, I’m not a fan of expensive. My tart pan was $2.50 at the Good Will. I wanted to keep this dessert low budget too. I went to the store and looked for the cheapest fruit available. That’s my strategy because generally the cheapest fruit is in season.\\nNectarines were $0.50/lb. So awesome. It took about $1.50 worth of fruit to make this tart. Beautiful and frugal. I’m into it.\\nPrepare pie crust by combing flour, sugar and salt. Using your fingers, break the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles very coarse crumbs (even pea sized is fine). Add ice water and bring it all together into a ball using your hands. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate a few hours. You can make this up to two days in advance (or much longer and freeze it).\\nOnce the dough has rested enough (a few hours or days), roll out and place into a 9 inch fluted tart pan (this will also work in a pie dish). Place in freezer while you make the filling and topping.\\nDice nectarines (leave the skin on) and combine with sugar, flour, cinnamon and rum. Set aside and make the topping. In a bowl, combine ingredients for filling. Using your fingers, work ingredients together (feel free to add more pistachios if you’d like) until the texture of coarse crumbs.\\nNow assemble tart. Place nectarine filling into prepared tart pan. Top with crumble topping. Lay a few thin pats of butter over the top. Bake for about an hour and a half, or until filling is bubbling and top is golden.\\nAllow to cool completely.

In a quiet, dimly lit room, young designers sit at rows of computers, modeling birds, locomotives and girls wearing capes.\\nThis a cartoon command center, one of 16 nationwide. Set up over a three-year period thanks to tax incentives, subsidies and bonuses, the centers are part of Beijing’s ambitious plan to cultivate an animation industry able to contribute 1% of national GDP within 10 years. The figure stood at 0.1% in 2005.\\nChina’s short-term strategy seems to be a production blitz coupled with government measures to ensure domestic cartoons are aired. China produced 102,000 minutes of animation in 2007, up 20% from the previous year and 137% from 2005, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.\\nIn May, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television extended a 2006 ban on broadcasting foreign cartoons by an hour, creating a daily blackout period that runs from 5 pm to 9 pm. Stations must also show seven minutes of domestic cartoons for every three minutes of foreign output. As a result, Chinese animators claimed a 50% market share last year, up from 15% several years ago.\\nBut a torrent of animation minutes does not add up to profits or prestige for most of the country’s 5,400 cartoon companies. Though Beijing dreams of a world-class animation industry to compete with Disney or Dreamworks, a local industry champion is unlikely to emerge soon, as broadcasters still favor studios that produce cheaply and bountifully.\\nFor televised animation, broadcasters like CCTV and provincial television stations pay studios by the minute. Higher-quality 3D animation fetches a higher price than 2D. Paying more for better animation should, in theory, attract more viewers, and allow stations to charge higher advertising rates. But state-controlled CCTV is less dependent on advertising revenue than a private broadcaster would be. Filling cartoon quotas – not boosting TV ratings – is its top priority. A survey by the China Animation & Comics Association found that only 11% of Chinese teenagers preferred domestic cartoons, compared with 60% who favored ones from Japan.\\n“Lots of poor-quality animated TV shows are just being made blindly,” said Ye Min, director of the animation series Magic Wonderland, produced by Hangzhou-based Zhongnan Animation.\\nMany in the industry point to the low amount CCTV pays studios for their work as a major obstacle toward higher-quality animation.\\nCCTV pays a “a few hundred yuan” per minute for animation, but production costs in China average RMB10,000 (US$1,500) per minute for 2D and RMB30,000 (US$4,400) for 3D, said Shen Yuliang, general manager of Zhongnan Animation. Last year, Zhongnan turned a profit for the first time since it was set up in 2005. It is rumored to be one of the only studios in Hangzhou to have crept into the black.\\nFor studios, getting paid at all is an improvement over the old system.\\n“Before, it was free for broadcasters to air cartoons,” said Nie Jinxing, media relations manager at Sunchime Cartoon Group, which produces Blue Cat, one of China’s most widely syndicated cartoon series since its launch in 1999. The company came close to bankruptcy in 2001, after spending US$8.7 million on production for a series that was broadcast by 15 television stations for free.\\nThough producing cartoons to broadcast pro bono was an extreme, global animation markets aren’t set up much differently. Worldwide, animation companies make very little money from broadcasting, but profit from DVDs, toys and other merchandise that the cartoon programs themselves advertise.\\nUnfortunately for Chinese animators, these sources of revenue are virtually non-existent. Merchandizing is underdeveloped, while DVD sales are undermined by China’s virulent pirate market.\\nSunchime told Asia Times last year that it estimates the value of Blue Cat and its derivative products at US$582 million annually, but only makes US$14-29 million.\\nPiracy and lack of profitability are also dissuading potential foreign investors.\\nForeign studios have outsourced labor-intensive, technical animation work to China since the 1990s, but they rarely invest in the country’s animation industry. This results in limited foreign expertise at China’s new animation bases – one reason the industry is short of creative directors and storytellers.\\nA creative vision to shape the millions of cartoon minutes into a world-class industry is not a matter of numbers.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-24T01:02:37Z', 'url': 'https://chinaeconomicreview.com/wishful-thinking/'}\n","{'text': '(Remember) when the angels said: \"O Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him (God), whose name is the Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, revered in this world and the Hereafter, and one of those brought near (to God).

The Committee said in the Preface to The Holy Bible (Revised Standard Version), p. iv: \"Sometimes it is evident that the text has suffered in transmission, but none of the versions provides a satisfactory restoration. Here we can only follow the best judgement of competent scholars as to the most probable reconstruction of the original text.\" The Committee also said in the Preface, p. vii: \"Notes are added which indicate significant variations, additions, or omissions in the ancient authorities (Mt 9.34; Mk 3.16; 7.4; Lk 24.32, 51, etc.).\"\\nBid\\'ah (innovation) in Islam is defined as any invented way in religion that is aimed at worshipping or drawing closer to Allaah subhanahu wata\\'ala. This means anything that is not referred to specifically in Sharee\\'ah, and for which there is no evidence (daleel) in the Qur\\'aan or Sunnah, and which was not known at the time of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and his Companions. At the same time, it is quite obvious that this definition of religious inventions or innovations, which are condemned, does not include worldly inventions [such as cars and washing machines, etc. - Translator].', 'timestamp': '2019-04-20T21:01:28Z', 'url': 'https://www.linktoislam.net/islamic-articles/article.aspx?id=47'}\n","{'text': '\"At this point, we\\'re more concerned about the risk of a downgrade than a default,\" said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Belton said the loss of the country\\'s AAA rating may rattle markets, but it\\'s \"better than missing an interest payment.\"\\nEven with a deadline to raise the U.S. debt limit less than a week away, many investors still believe Washington will pull off a last-minute deal to avoid a catastrophic default. Washington has until Aug. 2 to raise the country\\'s $14.3 trillion borrowing limit or risk missing a payment on its debt. President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans have failed to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and pass a larger budget-cutting package. Politicians have tied raising the debt limit and spending cuts together.\\nBut at least one credit rating agency has already made it clear that unless that agreement includes at least $4 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade, the country\\'s AAA rating could be lost. Right now, the proposals under discussion cut around $2 trillion or less.\\nStandard & Poor\\'s warned earlier this month that there was a 50-50 chance of a downgrade, if Congress and President Obama failed to find a \"credible solution to the rising U.S. government debt burden.\" S&P said it may cut the U.S. rating to AA within 90 days. Passing a $4 trillion agreement could prevent a downgrade, S&P said.\\nThe other chief rating agency, Moody\\'s Investors Service, said the U.S. government would likely keep its top rating if it avoids a default.\\nSpokesmen from both Moody\\'s and S&P said they wouldn\\'t comment beyond their recent reports.\\nBelton estimates that borrowing costs would rise between 0.60 to 0.70 points. That may not sound like much. But mortgage interest rates, which have hovered around 4.5 percent for the last several weeks, could rise by at least that amount, to more than 5.1 percent.\\nAnd for the federal government, it eventually means an extra $100 billion in interest payments to Treasury holders like China each year.\\n\"That\\'s a huge number,\" Belton said. That $100 billion a year that could be spent elsewhere on everything from education to infrastructure.\\nAn increase in interest rates could soon become a drag on other parts of the economy, experts say. State governments and insurance agencies would also be downgraded — and states are already having financial troubles. Business confidence could sink again, leading to prolonged high unemployment.\\nBut some investors aren\\'t unhappy about the thought of a U.S. debt downgrade. Don Quigley, manager of the $1.5 billion Artio Total Return Bond fund reasons that such a move could provide a buying opportunity. He believes that a downgrade would immediately send the yield of the 10-year bond up to 3.15 percent from its current level of about 3 percent.\\nIf the economy sinks further in part because of higher interest rates, investors would very likely return to buying bonds, Quigley said. That\\'s what they\\'ve done during the last several years both during the financial crisis and recession, and again the last several months as the economic recovery has slowed.\\nTreasurys would keep their allure, in part, because there are few alternatives for large foreign buyers looking for a market big enough to handle massive investments.\\n\"The German market is not big enough and Japan has its own problems,\" Quigley said.\\nA cut to the U.S. credit rating could hit stocks harder than bonds. A study by Janney Montgomery Scott looked at rating changes to countries over the past decade. After Spain was downgraded in 2009, Spain\\'s stock market fell 8 percent in three months. A cut to Japan\\'s credit rating in 2011 knocked the country\\'s stock market down 3.4 percent in three months. The study, released in April, suggested the S&P 500 would fall 6% after a U.S. downgrade, erasing all its gains for the year.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-18T10:31:28Z', 'url': 'https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/debt-limit-downgrade1st-ldwritethru/2011/07/26/id/404944/'}\n","{'text': \"You have found your Bremerton WA Tile Roofing Maintenance Contractor that will do quality Tile Roofing work for you!\\nAt Ampro Roofing we have been the Tile Roofing Maintenance Contractor in Bremerton WA for our customers for years.

Although it was my highest score on my ACTs (how?), Math, for the most part, is preferably in my past. We memorized multiplication, were plagued by pesky word problems, gritted our teeth while we graphed. I retained and can recite a few formulas from class – The Pythagorean Theorem = A squared + B squared = C squared, and although I’d like to think that Geometry has helped me while playing pool, Math doesn’t mix with my mindset. In the case of Pittsburgh professional Xander Demos, though, I see numbers with new knowledge!\\nWhen it comes to Xander Demos, the numbers are very clear to calculate. His last two singles made their way to number 1 on Myspace’s Metal and Progressive chart. He will be featured on two future compilations, Liberty N Justice’s “Cigar Chronicles” and Raging Storm Records’ “Night Of the Living Shred,” and also will appear on Ged Ryland’s solo CD, due out soon. Xander has innumerable endorsements and has been featured on no fewer than 5 shows and sites, including The Real Radio Show with AJ Pero of Twisted Sister, Steve Vai’s GuitarTV.com, GuitarWorld.com, Hair Metal Mansion and Iron City Rocks.\\nMixed by CJ Snare of Firehouse, it contains 10 tracks of combustible guitar content. Mr. Demos will also be delivering an instructional DVD and sharing his skills to interested students. A collection of his endorsements include EMG Pickups, Conklin Guitars, ISP Technologies, David Thomas McNaught Guitars, GraphTech, V-Picks, Jim Dunlop Strings and Accessories, Hughes and Kettner, Tremol-No, FloydUpgrades.com, Scott Dixon Cases and Suhr Guitars, Amps & Effects. Xander exclusively uses the FloydUpgrades tremolos or the GraphTech LB-63 piezo-equipped Floyd tremolo and has Xander Demos signature series guitars both 6-string and 7-string models. However, you don’t need to know extensive knowledge about guitars to enjoy his efforts.\\nWhat Mr. Demos delivers is a really diverse range that is both nostalgic and new. You can head-bang without the head ache, as he comes through clean and clear, cutting like a capable musical carver. Also an avid animal aid, Xander donated some of his EP sales to various animal charities. When you add it all up, Xander Demos is the correct answer to the mathematical musical equation, and that’s always a lesson I look forward to learning!\\nSara Fincham: Talk about the importance of Pittsburgh in your work.

There is also studio space that young artists can use for free to create a project then see it exhibited in the gallery.\\nEverything at House of Vans is free to attend, although available on a first come first served basis. The idea, marketing vice president Jeremy de Maillard tells Marketing Week, is to make the space feel like a “house where everyone is welcome”.\\nHe highlights that this is not a short-term project, with Vans leasing the space for five years with the aim of integrating its brand into the local community. Vans will be supporting three local charities as part of the project and investing in the local skateboarding and creative scenes.\\n“We want this to be a stepping stone for artists and creatives in London. This is a way of showcasing the brand experience – we want to be synonymous with creativity,” de Maillard says.\\nThere are no Vans products for sale at House of Vans, although there is a museum showcasing some of the brands iconic products. De Maillard says the aim is not to sell but to immerse people in the Vans brand and make them feel part of the “Vans family”.\\nHe hopes that by making this investment the brand will experience a boost in brand equity, loyalty and increased purchase consideration and transactions.\\nIt will be launching a membership programme that gives subscribers advantages such as priority for gig tickets and skateboarding sessions. For the most loyal, there are plans to offer “VIP” events such as a private session in the skate park with some of the big names in skateboarding.\\nVans will not charge for the scheme itself but will require members to donate what they can afford to its charity partners.\\nIt is also extending the project into the digital world with the aim of reaching a further 1 million people that might not be able to attend the space in person. The whole place is wired with HD cameras and Vans is planning live web casts of big events that will be shared on a dedicated House of Vans London website, as well as on social media.\\nThere is also free Wi-Fi throughout the space so visitors can share their experiences on social media.\\n“We are trying to mix the digital and physical worlds. The consumer today is on their phone the whole time but we believe there is still a strong need for physical experiences and the more the world becomes digital the more meaningful and impactful those true authentic physical experiences become,” says de Maillard.\\nLondon is the second House of Vans project to go live, with the first opening in Brooklyn in 2010.

It feels like RSS feeds are becoming more and more common every day. Part of this is due to the growing popularity of blogs, and partly because web users are becoming a little more savvy.\\nOnce upon a time there was a web user. We’ll call her Betty. Betty found a blog she liked to read, and she checked back daily for new posts. Then Betty found out about some more blogs she liked, so she started checking those daily too. It wasn’t look before Betty was checking 30 blogs every day – and wow, it was starting to take a while!\\nThis is where RSS feeds come in. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a way for a blog to make its content available in an easily transportable format.

The survey revealed high pay across the board for NPs along with several benefits.\\nNurse practitioners are earning high wages. Let us help you get started in the field.\\nAccording to the survey, 22.5% of nurse practitioners are paid at an hourly rate. For an NP at a full-time practice, the hourly pay rate hovered around $53.16. The vast majority of NPs (74.7%) are salaried, with their annual base sitting at around $97,083.\\nOn top of salary, 30.1% of NPs reported incentive and productivity bonuses. Most (41.3%) received bonuses based on practice revenue or profit, while 31.8% reported bonuses based on quality measures and 27.7% received bonuses based on patient satisfaction.\\nAdditional benefits reported in the survey were as follows: 71.9% of employers were reported to offer continuing education reimbursement while others offered 66.7% professional leave to attend conferences or meetings, and 54% of employers covered costs for registration for said conferences and meetings.\\nPay for nurse practitioners has risen since 2013 and now is as good a time as ever to join the workforce.

As the other three Tocs Borderers took their intervals in the snaking Indian single file line behind him, Kerr wondered if they were going to be hit today. Other patrols had taken a walloping in the past month. He and his men had been lucky so far.\\nImprovised Explosive Devices (IEDs) created from scavenged military munitions, mines, old fashioned dynamite or in some cases a few hundred pounds of fertilizer, easily found on the surrounding farms outside of the city. Bomb making had seemingly become a fashionable hobby among the remaining Yordist insurgents left behind ensuring the populace remained stirred up and unable to make a normal life for themselves.\\nThe squad sighed with relief as one as they rested packs against the cool shady wall of the fountain. It’s bubbling water cool and tranquil to the mind. Kerr filled his pipe and kept watch on the rooftops and alleys as his lads drank water, smoked and hurriedly wolfed down a bit of cold ration. His squad’s chosen man, Craig Cormier, silently chewed on a dry cracker topped with some sort of meat paste as he watched the locals moving by them as they sat. He would bring up the rear of the formation when they moved out on the second leg of the routine patrol.\\nThese patrols never took the same route, they always changed, but this precaution was somewhat affected by the fact they had to always cover the same ground. Ground dictated by the confines of their current area of operation this made them vulnerable to sudden attack by a variety of different means.\\nThe ten minute respite passed all too quickly.\\n“Off and on! Time ta earn yer pay.” Kerr commanded his Borderers. Once again the patrol paced its way along the street, the crowd thinning as they went, until there were only a very few civilians around them. Kerr tensed, his senses on edge as he noted this. Sometimes in Yordist friendly areas the civilians were warned of bad things about to happen. Passing a short row of vendors carts Chosen Man Cormier was startled to see one of the brightly coloured cart balloons seem to catch the breeze and break away from its fellows in the bunch. Cormier’s guts froze as he realized there was no wind!\\nKerr felt himself get pushed to the ground by the blast wave before he heard the roar of the explosion close behind him. He tried to focus but his mind was numb. He was slow to react to the stinging chips of brick splattering his body as the incoming 9mm rounds chewed up the walls and suddenly he noticed one of them was, Cormier had charged forward towards the ambush point and was laying down covering fire and yelling for the others to pull themselves together and “Get a bloody move on!” There were civilians screaming and crying all around them as they scrambled to get out of the way of the fighting. The scene seemed surreal as while Kerr could see lips moving and weapons flashes, he couldn’t hear a single sound.\\nA copy of IAG001 Firefight 2.0 Killing Streets for the Firefight rules is necessary to play this mission. Also required are two squads of ION Age Muster miniatures.\\nThis mission is for two players, with one player taking a Canlastrian squad of Mustermen out on a routine street patrol.\\nThe other player commands a squad of Yordist Mustermen insurgents, out to destroy the Canlastrians by any and all means possible.\\nThe objective of this mission for the Yordist is to kill every single Canlastrian mercenary, utilizing the surprise blast of a concealed Air Mine and a hidden ambush to do so.\\nThe objective of this mission for the Canlastrian player is to survive the initial onslaught, recover and then destroy their attackers. See the special rules for this scenario.\\nA line of four street boards running North-South. It is flanked by buildings and alleyways. The alleyways are represented by 2x5 pavement sections. The Yordist player can place three Skimmers (1x2, DS2), two of the big cars (2x2, DF3) and one of the small cars (2x2, DF2) to represent market vendor’s stalls anywhere on the road edges. Then place 2 debris markers randomly on each street board (use 1D6 x 1D6 to determine square, just re-roll any sixes).\\nYou have a 105 point veteran squad of Muster troops. One veteran Emeritas and three Privates, all armed with Moth Type VI Automatic Rifles. You may have four troopers armed with a Hobbes Bomb or two troopers armed with two Hobbes Bombs each. Place the Scouts on any of the P1 starting places at the south end of the battlefield. On game turn one, your patrol will move north with the intent of exiting the north end of the street on the other side of the battlefield.\\nThere are no alternate options for this squad.\\nYou have a 96 point squad of Muster troops. One Emeritas and three Privates, all armed with Moth Type VI Automatic Rifles. You may have up to two troopers armed with a Hobbes Bomb each or one trooper armed with two Hobbes Bombs.\\nYou also have one Air Mine to place, before play begins secretly designate one Skimmer on the board to be your Air Mine booby trapped vendor cart. It’s placement will designate where your squad will deploy (details below). Its cost is included in the calculated total force points above.\\nYour forces do not start the game on the board. Once the Air Mine has detonated and damage calculated, immediately deploy your forces as follows: Place two men in the building across the road, opposite from where the Air Mine/Skimmer was initially placed, on ‘off-board’ squares adjacent to the road (see special rules for building details and the map for an example of where these deployment squares would be if the centre skimmer was the Air Mine). Then place a stolen 1x2 Skimmer, on any alley entryway of your choice (the front of the vehicle level with the road, example shown on map) at least 2D6 squares ahead of the place where the mine detonates. The Skimmer may immediately move up to 1D6 plus 1 squares, where the remaining two men get out of the vehicle and deploy behind it. Note that on the turn of deployment the Yordists may not move. They may use all of the normal Target Response Options although the two men by the Skimmer are down 1 dice on this first turn. From the following turn Initiative is rolled for as normal.\\nThere are two special rules in use for this mission. Please read and apply it in your playing of Firefight for this mission.\\n1. IED – In this mission the Air Mine is used slightly differently to normal. As the Canlastrian patrol is the only one on the table at the start of the scenario, each turn before the Canlastrians move the Yordist player can move any one of the 1x2 Skimmers on the board 1 space towards the Canlastrians. He does not have to move the one with the Air Mine. He may detonate the mine on any turn he wishes before the Canlastrians move. Once detonated and damage calculated he then deploys his forces as above. This rule represents the Canlastrians belief they are moving through a marketplace, and are not expecting an Air Mine to be hidden in one of the vendors carts.\\n2. Buildings – The ‘off-board’ sections between alleyways are considered to be buildings. After the Air Mine has detonated and the Yordists deployed, the central square of the building they are in which faces each alleyway and the road are considered normal entrances into the building. It costs two general dice to move through. On the accompanying map an example of these entrances are shown, marked by green squares. The Yordists in the building are initially placed adjacent to the wall facing the road. They count as being in Hard Cover when being targeted, it does not affect them firing as per the normal rules.\\nThis mission is part of the Pacification Firefight 2.0 Campaign Mission Arc, set after the fall of Bosworth IV, and should be played with other missions in the Arc in the correct order.\\nIt may also be played as a stand-alone scenario, in which case it may be expanded by up to two squads of mustermen per side. Or you may try using Retained posts instead of mustermen, or a mix of Mustermen and the Retained to fight the scenario. It makes for a highly entertaining game.\\nThis mission is the fifth of a series of missions in a Firefight 2.0 Campaign Arc which is meant to show the difficulties faced by an occupying force in a built up area in time of war. I have drawn upon the reports of recent military experiences in the modern age and have applied them to this mission arc. When the players have finished all of the missions, it is my hope they will be enlightened to the truly difficult job military personnel have when forced by circumstance and orders to occupy and garrison a city in a foreign land.\\nThis mission introduces the guerrilla or ‘small war’ tactic of ambush, which the players will find to be a very deadly game for their soldiers.\\nIn play testing this mission, my brave Tocs were able to recover and fight their Yordist foes to a draw twice in three games. The third game a number of fortunate rolls for the Yordist enabled them to wipe out the Canlastrians without losing a man!

What are Bonds Good For?\\nWhat is a Termite Bond? What are They Good For & are Bonds Worth the Cost?\\n>> What is a Termite Bond? What are They Good For & are Bonds Worth the Cost?\\nWondering how much is your termite bond?\\nYou found termite damage to your house, went through the whole process of hiring an exterminator to inspect the damage, then had several treatments to take care of the problem. This shouldn’t be the end of your efforts to eradicate termites from your home, however, since a house with previous termite damage is likely to experience a recurrence of the infestation at some point in the future.\\nPeople in places like Alabama are fond of saying, “There are two kinds of houses: those with termites and those that will have them.” How can you keep up with extermination costs that potentially recur every year? Look into the benefits of a termite bond.\\nWhat is a termite bond? It is a contract or guarantee entered into between a homeowner/business owner and their exterminator. After a building is treated for termites, a bond ensures future inspection and treatment at no cost to the customer beyond the bond renewal fee.\\nWill the cost of the bond amount to less than the expected expenses should reinfestation occur?\\nDoes the bond cover both inspection and full retreatment?\\nWill the bond cover any damages related to termites causing future damage to the house?\\nAre you in an area with different kinds of termites? If so, will a bond cover all types of termites returning in the future?\\nIf retreatment is needed and the new infestation is more extensive, will the company cover measures beyond the initial service (i.e. if only liquid is used the first time will they cover fumigation in the future)?\\nIn order to understand how a termite bond works, you should know the basics of the termite extermination process. The first step is a thorough inspection to determine the type of termite, location of the infestation, and the extent of the damage. All of these factors taken together will determine the method used. Serious infestations usually require fumigation. In fact, a lot of title companies require fumigation before a home with any kind of termite damage is sold to a new owner. Typically, termite fumigations take around three days to complete.\\nThe basic termite bond should cover a yearly inspection and, if termites return, future extermination costs. Initial extermination may be as low as $1,500 for a small area and basic treatment, and a large home with a significant problem can cost up to $5,000 to treat. In the first case, a bond fee of $200 per year may not be worth it, especially if you live in an area with infrequent infestations. Wise Geek features a concise article on termite bonds that recommends comparing the annual cost of a bond with the price of re-extermination for your house.\\nYou cannot assume a termite bond will cover any and all damages caused by future infestations. Some bonds are for extermination costs only while others promise to repair a limited amount of damages to your house if the termites return within a certain time frame. The kind of termite in your house can affect the bond as well, says Orkin; if the initial treatment was for one type of termite and another kind re-infests your house, the bond may not apply. This may also be the case if the first time you have an issue in your basement, for example, but the next time find termites on the outside of your foundation.\\nIf you have questions about termites bonds because you are buying or selling a house, look closely at the bond’s transfer limitations. For buyers purchasing a home with a previous termite problem, make sure the bond can and is transferred to you as the new homeowner. This way you are not on the hook for extermination costs that should have been covered by the previous owner. You will, however, need to take on the responsibility of the bond’s annual fees to continue the contract with the exterminator.\\nAs a home seller, you should invest in a bond to increase the chances you will sell a home with termite damages. Homeowners’ insurance does not cover termite damage– a reinfestation too soon after the sale of your house could leave you paying the new homeowners’ extermination bills. Savvy buyers may not even consider buying from you without a bond in place. With a transferable bond, you can hand off the agreement to the new homeowner, they take on the cost of the bond, and you don’t have to worry about the termites coming back to a home you no longer own.\\nIf you’ve recently had your home exterminated for termites and did not arrange for a bond with your pest control company, you may want to contact them and see if you can still sign an agreement. If you are buying or selling a home with previous termite problem and don’t know have never heard of a termite bond before, definitely educate yourself and make a termite bond part of your home buying or selling process. Just make sure the terms are agreeable to you and the needs of your house.\\nIn answer to the question, “What is a termite bond?” you could say simply it is a contract that guarantees future treatment if termites return. Another way to see it is an added form of insurance that protects the value and condition of your house and other buildings. You will need to decide for yourself if the continuing, nominal cost of a termite bond is worth it; many people who live in areas where termites are a constant problem and go through having to pay for termite extermination once see the value in it.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-25T23:52:23Z', 'url': 'https://neverpest.com/what-is-a-termite-bond/'}\n","{'text': 'For a varied selection of carefully selected original arts and crafts from artisans based in Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, Wales you’d do well to mark the dates of our next Craft Fairs in Narberth, Pembrokeshire.\\nOur long established craft fairs feature exhibitors who are chosen for their quality of work and products for original gifts, house decorations or as collectibles.\\nThere’s something for everybody and you’ll find jewellery, gifts, pickles, clothing and apparel, pottery, art and lots lots more.\\nJoin us at our next fair or subscribe to our mailing list to be kept informed.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-26T07:51:13Z', 'url': 'http://pigstreetcrafts.co.uk/'}\n","{'text': 'Jessie J is coming to \"Bang Bang\" collaborator Ariana Grande\\'s defense against those nasty diva rumors.

But when McCluskey reimagines them on canvas, the familiar begins to stir.\\nBrick and mortar. Cobblestones and canals. All bend, curve, twist and turn. You can almost hear the music. Feel the energy. It’s an invitation to step inside McCluskey’s world, where cityscapes seem to breathe.\\nLowell, after all, is where she found inspiration to pick up a paintbrush again at age 40. Her success as a full-time working artist in Paris is proof, she says, that it’s never too late to pursue a dream.\\nSlogging along the daily grind, McCluskey’s art supplies ended up in boxes in a basement. She carried old photos of her favorite works with her as a reminder from time to time of who she was before becoming a mom, a wife and a cubicle dweller.\\nSometimes life holds up a mirror and forces you to take a long hard look. Maybe it was the milestone, but McCluskey recalls her 40th birthday jogging something awake inside her.\\nAnd just like that, she put her dreams in action. With her kids Jake and Carly all grown up, she enrolled in college courses at UMass Lowell. Back at school, she travelled to France for a painting workshop and fell in love with her life all over again.\\nShe was the happiest she had been in a long time, then tragedy struck. Her partner of six years, Ed McCabe, was killed in a motorcycle accident in 2001.\\n“I felt like my life was over,” McCluskey admits.\\nBut in the shadow of her grief, she managed to find a sliver of light.\\nA close friend told her not to focus on the long and rolling highway. Follow the little paths life offers up instead. With nothing left to lose, McCluskey moved to France in January 2002. She was 44.\\nPicking up her brushes and paint again, she was reborn. Enter Linda McCluskey, the artist. Paris gave her freedom to rediscover and reinvent herself.\\n“In Paris, if you say you’re a painter, people don’t ask, ‘what do you really do?’ ” she explains.\\nIn 2004, a move into a 6th floor studio overlooking St. Germaine Boulevard gave her a new perspective. Being a “country girl” born and raised in Chelmsford, she had never lived up so high.\\nThe scenes unfolding on her canvas were well painted but still focused on proper form, until a trip to surrealist painter Salvador Dali’s beloved village of Cadaques in Spain pushed her brush in a whole new direction.\\nThe natural beauty of Cadaques inspired Dali and the way he interpreted that on canvas brought attention to the region. Taking in the breathtaking view from a hillside, McCluskey did a Dali-esque painting of the village and the church melting over the mountains.\\n“After painting traditional views for so long, this felt like freedom to play and make up the impossible,” she says.\\nIt was the beginning of McCluskey’s imaginative “distortion” pieces, and she gained recognition as a unique artist in Paris and in Lowell.\\nShe returns to Lowell each year for inspiration.\\nWhere Middle and Palmer streets intersect.\\nShe points to her painting of Lowell’s Middle Street, one of her favorite downtown spots.\\nToday she has her own studio at Paris’ 59 Rivoli — one of the top three visited galleries in France — where she was accepted for a permanent residency.

So legitimate email from ICIWorld can be trapped in your SPAM FOLDER. Yet each EMail contains information for contacts for potential real estate transactions. The spam folder is is different from junk. Look for a column of folders one called “more.” You will find a spam folder there. You can put a check mark on the listing and click on Not Spam. If you have not done this before, you will probably find other mail that should not be spam. However marking mail as not spam does not seem to work all the time. Mail seems to continue to go to spam. So GMail has another option. Another way you can try to keep it out of spam you have to set a filter.\\nGmail’s filters allow you to manage the flow of incoming messages. Using filters, you can automatically label, archive, delete, star, or forward your mail, even keep it out of Spam. There is a Filter Choice to choose Not Spam. https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en&ctx=mail This is a work in progress to figure out how to get google to allow all our legitimate mail to get through to you properly without always going to spam.\\nDatabase 2 FSBO Area – Executive Members of ICIWorld can subscribe to receive EMail from the FSBO (For Sale By Owner) EMail List Servers.

For a whole gamut of reasons, at some stage during their time spent at school, most kids experience some kind of school-related anxiety. Whether it be separation anxiety in the early years, anxiety about testing and assessment or social anxiety, the reasons are many but the negative effects often the same. Teaching mindfulness is one way that educators and parents alike can help to build the coping skills kids need when they are faced with challenging situations and environments.\\nMindfulness is the practice of paying attention, on purpose, to the present moment (Grossman, 2016). It’s something that came so naturally to us as small children, when we could easily spend time silently mesmerised by a single ant wandering across the ground. Though it’s true that as we get older, as our understanding of the world grows wider and our minds subsequently busier, that time spent in silent wonderment doesn’t happen quite so easily.\\nTeaching children the conscious skill of mindfulness is an empowering one. The ability to stop, to centre ourselves, to notice what is happening in any given moment goes a long way towards self-regulation and self-awareness. For children who experience anxiety, whether situational or prolonged, having simple and familiar thoughts or actions to call upon during times of stress become important, lifelong skills.\\nMindfulness is a superpower that everyone can have. To activate this superpower we only need two things, our mind and our breath. It is for this reason, and so many more, that teaching mindfulness to children is something that should be on every teacher, parent and carers’ radar.\\nWith that in mind, here are some fun and simple ways to introduce the concept of mindfulness to young children.\\nThis simple activity is a way to teach your child about “belly breathing”. Centering our thoughts and emotions through our breath is a wonderful self-regulation skill for everyone to learn.\\nLay down on the floor beside your child and place a small soft toy, like the little wuppy®, or any other light-weight object such as a small bean bag or wooden block onto your belly buttons.\\nWith your child, lay still and watch the toy move up and down as you both breathe in and out.\\nTalk with your child about what you notice. About how quickly or slowly the toy moves.\\nYou can also count as your child breathes in “1, 2, 3” and breathes out “1, 2, 3”.\\nAnother beautiful child-friendly reframing of a traditional mindfulness practice is to go on a Mindful Safari.\\nTake your child outside into nature and tell them that you are both going to go exploring. That you need to discover what creatures, plants and other natural objects are close by.\\nTell your child to turn their sense of sight, touch and sound onto high. Remind them that they need to be so, so quiet that they can move around without scaring any little creatures away.\\nWhen you find a creature or beautiful object, pause and look at it closely for a while.\\nSignal to your child to remain quiet, putting your finger to your lips. They will love the adventure!\\nAfter some time spent observing in silence, quietly ask your child some questions.\\nThe free Nature Scavenger Hunt Grid on the Teach Starter website can make your Mindful Safari a fun one.\\nGuided meditations are a great way to familiarise kids with the language of mindfulness and meditation. There are a number of fantastic apps with free guided meditations. Smiling Minds has great meditations for both children and adults, while Insight Timer is a fantastic free app for adults.\\nA “Breathing Colours” guided meditation introduces a simple visualisation to help children focus on using their breath for relaxation.\\nAsk your child to think of a relaxing colour. It can be any colour they like, as long as it is one that makes them think of relaxation.\\nThen ask them to think of a colour that represents stress, sadness or anger. Whichever of those emotions is most relevant or suitable for your child group to explore.\\nWith your spoken guidance, your child imagines breathing in the relaxing colour and visualises it filling their lungs.\\nThen they imagine breathing out the stress, sadness or anger colour.\\nThere are many ways to teach mindfulness to children. Ultimately, any time that you spend with your child consciously slowing down, and bringing awareness to the moment, will help to build their own repertoire of self-awareness and emotional regulation skills.\\nCassie Nguyen is a former school teacher and fellow anxiety-conqueror.

Safety is one very important reason - but also to have an enjoyable time together with your horse and not the fearful, exhausting fight because the horse and rider do not communicate well. We often blame the horse, but in reality we are to blame, since in most cases it is lack of communication skills from the person, who does not speak \"horse\". When people ask me: My horse is bucking with me, can you fix it? I answer with another question: When and why do yo think your horse is bucking? I can \"fix\" it in most cases, but that would be like removing the symptoms and not the reason for the bucking which in most cases is due to something the rider does. So the horse will continue bucking when his owner continues to do the same thing. Learning to be in control, dominate and become the leader of the horse- - not by showing the horse \"who is the boss\" which will create fear in this prey and flight animal rather than trust - and in it for the horse dangerous situation, the horse will take leadership and do what HE thinks best: RUN. So if the rider has not earned the leadership over the horse, the horse might LIKE the person, but not trust the person to make good decisions if they are scared. We give people tools to learn this language and how to earn the title of being the protector of the horse.\\nThe understanding of directing the energy instead of confining it ( which is our usual predator instinct to do) is the key. Preventing a prey and flight animal from running in a situation he is fearful, will only add to this fear. A good way of fixing a bad habit is to become part of the solution for the horse by directing his energy immediately after his attention is back to the person. The instructor, Danehill’s owner Karin Dilou, is passionate about passing on the horsemanship knowledge she has learned \"the hard way\" herself over a long life living with her herd of Danish warmblood horses. A basic key ingredient for success to learn this is patience with ourselves and being observant and focused. It gives her utmost pleasure to give her students tools to become, confident, focused, goal, respectful and happy protectors which is what the horses are looking for in a herd leader. Jokingly we refer to Danehill Manor as: The Stress Free Zone. Having stress, being irritable or impatient, fearful, angry etc. will NOT work in the communication with the horses. It needs to be assertive, firm, polite and precise when we gently ASK them (not make them) do things to get the response we are looking for. We need to be pro active by asking the horse to do something, before the horse makes a decision on his own that we then need to fix, The horse is \"telling us\" a lot through his body language and we get many warnings BEFORE they make their own decisions. You will learn to recognize the \"questions\" from the horse.\\nBy getting a deep understanding for this, has opened a door to knowledge about communication, leadership, teamwork and body language not only between horses and people, but very much between people too. The horses are in fact therefore also the co-facilitators when we run those seminars at Danehill. See further description under seminars.\\nThe students become “learners” through play. The horses like to play too. The old saying: when the student is ready, the teacher appears comes to mind. They learn for their own sake. The instructor does not explain in words to children what is going on between her, them and the horses, but do explain that to grown up clients before and after the actual interaction with the horses. Children naturally absorb the horses’ as well as the instructor’s body language, energy, attitude and focus which they subconsciously react to. Thus it is very important to be honest and congruent in words as well as body language how we feel in order to be successful with both the children and the horses in order to build up their trust and create a mutual respect. At the moment I have two 5 year old boys – the youngest students so far. It has taken awhile to build up the children’s attention and focus to ½ hour at a time and important not to \"force\" it, but continuously keep it interesting, rewarding and fun. It actually is the horses that \"reward\" the kids and they LOVE it when that happens, feeling in control with their bod language. To ALSO “be ahead of “ the child and at the same time “be ahead of the horse” with at least 4 horse lengths in decisions about what we want the horse to do (how fast or slow, to go right or left at which point, to turn etc.), is something I have developed over time. It takes patience and focus from my side too – both to the child AND the horse. Having done it over and over again together and then challenge the child to do it by himself when I feel they are ready is one of the “big moments” in the development of the child. When the child realizes his power and leadership skills giving these huge animals directions with small gestures what to do, when to run fast, slow turn and stop, and the horse actually listens to and responds in action to what the child asks him to do, is a wonderful experience.\\nThe students learn to pay attention at all times and think ahead. “Prevention is better than cure”. The most difficult thing to learn is patience with and respect to ourselves – which we also give our students tools to learn.\\nTo make a lesson with horses successful stress cannot be part of the day. A stressful (or in any way tense, frustrated, irritated or angry) person is NOT considered a trusting leader in the horse’s mind. If the person is tense or impatient because the horse is not doing, what the person THOUGHT he asked him to do, the horse will soon be frustrated and \"give up communicating\" with this person, since that handler in the horse\\'s mind does not seem to know what they want or doesn\\'t trust himself that the horse in fact WILL listen to his \"question\". The horse read\\'s the handler\\'s subconscious mind which often includes not trusting himself. That is reflected in his posture, energy, way of breathing etc. and we cannot lie or be ambiguous to the horses. That confuses them. The horse might do what we want them to if we beat them up or get rough with them– but out of fear - which is very counter productive if we want a good partnership with 51% leadership to the handler. In situations where they are frightened they will not trust the person’s decisions as a protector. - and that can be dangerous (bucking, rearing, running wild etc).\\nBeing on time or a little early is one of several things that can eliminate some stress. If prepared and thought through well in advance - step for step – and the student looks forward to a fun successful time, the lesson becomes pleasant for everybody.. I custom make the lessons to the children so it becomes a positive lovely experience for both them and the horses – (and me) - every time . Many factors can be different from time to time, but we always end on a positive note - both for the horse\\'s and for the handler\\'s sake.\\nOne thing that is important for the success with the kids is that parents or guardians do not interfere or “help” in any possible way from the moment they arrive at the gate. Children like horses can only have one leader over them, otherwise confusion sets in. Parents or guardians can always “follow up” afterwards by asking the students questions and have them -uninterruptedly while paying full attention to them - explain what they did. Having the child explain and maybe even teach the parent what to do, makes them learn even better. I LOVE it when my students correct ME - and THEY become the teacher. Mutual respect and attention to each other. The interference in the lesson confuses the child. As is the case with a horse: if several people try to tell them what to do, the horse will make his own decision and NOT consider any of them his trusting leader. That is when accidents happen. If the child wants to “show off” to the parent to get the much desired approval and burst of admiration – the “ego” comes in the way for the focus on the horse and the whole lesson will be counter productive. In many ways it is the case with adults too when they have an audience.\\nAsk, patiently wait for the response and praise when getting the desired “answer” - is the way for the horse – and the handler of the horse - to learn. If the horse didn’t do what we asked first time around, it was because we didn’t ask clearly enough in the horse’s language. Eventually it becomes “second nature” and the conversation/gestures lighter and lighter and when true unity is established it is merely a thought and the horse will respond. It feels as if the horse is psychic, but what it really is, is that he is reading your subconscious mind that is your true self and directly connected to your body language.\\nUnder construction, more information to come soon!', 'timestamp': '2019-04-21T16:26:11Z', 'url': 'https://www.danehillmanor.com/lessons'}\n","{'text': 'A new, segmented, negative-strand RNA virus with morphological and sequence similarities to other viruses in the genus Emaravirus was discovered in raspberry plants exhibiting symptoms of leaf blotch disorder, a disease previously attributed to the eriophyid raspberry leaf and bud mite (Phyllocoptes gracilis). The virus, tentatively named raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV), has five RNAs that each potentially encode a single protein on the complementary strand. RNAs 1, 2 and 3 encode, respectively, a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a glycoprotein precursor and the nucleocapsid. RNA4 encodes a protein with sequence similarity to proteins of unknown function that are encoded by the genomes of other emaraviruses. When expressed transiently in plants fused to green or red fluorescent protein, the RLBV P4 protein localized to the peripheral cell membrane and to punctate spots in the cell wall. These spots co-localized with GFP-tagged tobacco mosaic virus 30K cell-to-cell movement protein, which is itself known to associate with plasmodesmata. These results suggest that the P4 protein may be a movement protein for RLBV. The fifth RLBV RNA, encoding the P5 protein, is unique among the sequenced emaraviruses. The amino acid sequence of the P5 protein does not suggest any potential function; however, when expressed as a GFP fusion, it localized as small aggregates in the cytoplasm near to the periphery of the cell.\\nThe GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the sequences reported in this paper are FR823299 (RNA1), FR823300 (RNA2), FR823301 (RNA3), FR823302 (RNA4) and FR823303 (RNA5).\\nTwo supplementary figures and a supplementary table are available with the online version of this paper.\\nAhn K.

Despite the bill's passing through the state legislature with overwhelming bipartisan support, despite local newspaper editorials in favor of the bill, and despite more than 1,300 concerned Californians using our action center to urge him to sign the bill into law, Governor Brown instead decided to sell out privacy rights to law enforcement.\\nIt's not the first time, either. Last year, he did the same thing with SB 914, a bill that would have required police to obtain a search warrant before searching an arrested individual’s cell phone incident to arrest.\\nIt may be that legislative action is needed to keep the law current in our rapidly evolving electronic age. But I am not convinced that this bill strikes the right balance between the operational needs of law enforcement and individual expectations of privacy.\\nSkeptical about a law enforcement sponsored bill claiming to protect privacy? You should be. As we explained to Governor Brown, AB 2055 doesn’t do anything at all.\\nAB 2055 is a narrow response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Jones, which held the Fourth Amendment required law enforcement to obtain a search warrant before installing a GPS device on a car. In theory, AB 2055 changes California law to explicitly permit law enforcement to apply to a judge for a search warrant to install a GPS device. But in fact, it does not require police to obtain a search warrant. It just says they can apply for one. So to the extent it attempts to codify Jones, it fails. And, more basically, there’s no need to codify Jones: the Supreme Court’s decision is the law and California law enforcement officials have to follow it, regardless of what state law says.\\nThat’s not the only problem with AB 2055. That law only applies to GPS devices, and not the other myriad ways law enforcement can obtain location information without installing a GPS device. With increasing concern about law enforcement’s growing addiction to warrantless cell phone tracking — which a federal appeals court in New Orleans will be hearing argument about tomorrow — any legislative action needs to be forward-looking and future-proof. And while we might expect a state that boasts the world's biggest technology companies and just legalized self-driving cars to move the law forward, Governor Brown has instead decided to maintain the status quo.\\nUltimately law enforcement got exactly what it wanted with AB 2055, which is nothing at all. And while Governor Brown joins the chorus — which included Justice Alito in his concurring opinion in Jones — that solemnly speaks of the need to update our electronic privacy laws to reflect the changing technological landscape, his words ring hollow when he vetoes a bill that had bipartisan legislative support. Because in the end, all that's been done since the first federal electronic privacy bill was passed in 1986 has been a steady diet of allowing law enforcement to gorge itself on as much data and information they can eat without a warrant. It's no surprise that now they're hooked, they'll do whatever it takes to keep the information faucet on. Governor Brown's veto of SB 1434 only continues this dangerous trend.\", 'timestamp': '2019-04-22T12:15:13Z', 'url': 'https://www.eff.org/es/node/71964'}\n","{'text': \"Don't worry: The Italians designed the thing to look great at any of its five ride heights.\\nYesterday, with a Mediterranean flourish, two women clad in surprisingly-comprehensive dresses pulled a satin sheet from a windswept lump and revealed the new Maserati Levante.

That isn’t unfortunate, just a testament to the fact that there are only so many ways to shape a sport utility. (The new Jaguar F-Pace beautifully apes the first-generation BMW X5.) With eyes stolen from Maserati’s Afieri Concept, the Levante harbors as much squinty menace as its Quattroporte and Ghibli siblings and the typical Maserati cues, trident-inspired wheels, scalloped grill and fender portholes work together handsomely. Still, the Levante in person suffers some of what has undermined the Ghibli: a lack of presence. It’s striking but a little stubby, like Peter Dinklage.\\nDynamically, the Levante is bound to be athletic. In the U.S., it will come in two guises: The base model, at $72,000, with a 345-horsepower version of the Maserati 3-liter, twin-turbo V-6, and the S, priced around $83,000, with a 424-horsepower version of that same engine. The de rigeur 8-speed ZF transmission will be seamless; adaptive dampers and what Maserati says is the SUV world’s lowest center of gravity will keep things nice and planted, like a ball of burrata dropped on a tile floor. Perfect 50:50 front-rear weight distribution is nice, and gives future owners an excuse to demand passengers take odd seats to maintain balance, like a stewardess on a small regional turbo-prop.\\nI’m ambivalent. Unlike the aforementioned F-Pace, or Lincoln’s exuberant Navigator Concept, I didn’t immediately love the Levante. Then again, I had my fingers crossed for a run of original, 1967 Ghiblis suspended over monster-truck tires, which is called “setting yourself up for disappointment.” To muster up some appropriately passionate love for Maserati’s new truck, I talked to Giovanni Ribotta, Maserati’s Chief Exterior Designer. No one can better convince you of a child’s charms that its father. Here are four.\\nThe front of the Levante embodies the on-road/off-road duality Maserati wanted for its first truck. A dark, carbon fiber-effect skidplate juts out a touch beyond the bumper, almost like the spoiler of a racing car. According to Ribotta, the skid-plate is self-consciously “off-road, but integrated into a dynamic front.” As far as hammer-screwdrivers go, it’s a cute one.\\nRibotta pointed out that, absent bumpers and a couple other modern affectations, the Levante is working in the same design framework as some of Maserati’s most famous coupes. In his words: “The Levante shape is defined by a strong center spine and the four fenders—as a racing car, from the past. Like the Birdcage or a Type 61.” Does the Mercedes GLC bear the footprint of a 300SL Gullwing? We have yet to hear that case made.\\nWhen asked if he might be offended when future Levante owners adorned his streamlined design with awkward racks, rails and boxes, as SUV owners are wont to do, Ribotta smiled graciously. “We did our roof rails. We designed every accessory that will go on the car. With the engineering team, we tried to make the rails as slender as possible. And as beautiful. We aren’t angry.” If you do buy a Levante and take the thing to Vail, you won't enjoy the transgressive thrill of spoiling a the Levante's slick design. Settle instead for a drive in Maserati's handsome stab at market share—it should be a good one.\\nWhat's it like inside Maserati's first-ever SUV?

Whether you are a parent whose child has been injured or neglected at a daycare or you are a childcare facility accused of such conduct, we have the experience necessary to handle your case at any level.\\nParents place absolute trust in daycare facilities to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the most valued and vulnerable members of our society: our children. Unfortunately, annual statistics from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services show that there are more than 3,600 instances of abuse and neglect at daycare facilities nationwide each year.\\nIn 2014, state lawmakers enacted a law permitting licensed inspectors to inspect home daycare centers unannounced to ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing the operations of child care facilities. As a result of the new law, which was enacted following the death of a 3-month-old infant in Greenville County, DSS inspectors have closed over 50 child daycares since 2014.\\nDrowning in various bodies or pools of water.\\nMental and emotional injury can also result to the child, the effects of which may linger for years, potentially resulting in a significant claim against the daycare facility. These claims, which arise from a unique area of law, require the assistance of experienced counsel. Cases are often fact intensive and require attorneys with knowledge of the regulatory framework imposed by the S.C. Department of Social Services on child care service providers and capable of conducting a detailed investigation of the allegations in an effort to evaluate the potential liability. Furthermore, daycare abuse and neglect claims often require the identification and use of expert testimony to establish the nature and extent of the injuries suffered or likely to be suffered by the child. Punitive damages may be recoverable if the conduct of the daycare center or its employees was particularly egregious.\\nOur daycare abuse and neglect attorneys are experienced in representing both plaintiffs and defendants in cases involving allegations of physical injury, wrongful death, choking, suffocation, drowning, poisoning, burns, and sexual abuse. These cases can be complex because of the various laws, statutes, regulations, and administrative procedures that families and childcare facilities must navigate. Thus, it is imperative that you hire an attorney who has the experience necessary to ensure that your claim is handled properly. Our attorneys are equipped to provide you with competent counsel and assist you in navigating what is sure to be a very emotional ordeal for all involved.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-23T19:54:04Z', 'url': 'https://www.clawsonandstaubes.com/litigation/day-care/'}\n","{'text': 'Have you already bought kitchen and bathroom splashbacks?

The owner is extremely conscious of his female and racial minority clientele as he wants the range to be welcome to all, regardless of gender or race.

And I can punch holes in a quarter at 25 yards.\\nOther things, let's see. Go into a gun shop and get asked if I want a gift certificate.

A couple of weeks ago, Instagram promised you’d be able to download your data from its servers. It’s now rolled out that feature, as first reported by TechCrunch. It includes photos, videos, comments, profile information and more. It does not, however, appear to include all the analytics data the company has on you outside of what you’ve shared.\\nFor context: While we’d like to think Instagram will let you download your data simply out of the goodness of its heart, there are two major factors contributing to the decision.\\nFirst there’s the Cambridge Analytica scandal (I’m sure you’ve heard of it by now, but if you need a recap, our explainer post is here).\\nEven if Cambridge Analytica had never happened though, allowing users to download data is an important step for complying with Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Still, whether you’re on a desktop of smartphone, you can go ahead download your data by inputting your account information here.

Marangu route has been referred to as a Coca-cola route because there is no any challenge physical feature which might bring any difficult during climbing only the altitude can be a challenge on this route due to the few numbers of days for acclimatization but it is the only route which you have your accommodation in the Huts but only when you book in advance.\\nOn our last day, we have a long trek mostly downhill through the tropical rainforest. Once at the park headquarters at Marangu gate, we collect our summit certificates. A vehicle will meet us here and drive us back to your hotel in Moshi/Arusha.\\nYour trekking company is able to pick you up from the airport and bring your to your hotel in Moshi, if needed. A transfer back to the airport can also be arranged.\\nThe transport from Moshi to the gate of Kilimanjaro National Park is taken care off. This also applies to the way back.\\nUnless you are doing the Marangu Route, you’re staying in our strong and well maintained four season mountain tents. Every time you arrive at your camp the tent has already been set up.\\nOn the Marangu Route you will be provided with a bed in one of the huts on the way to Uhuru Peak. There are 60 bunk beds each at Mandara and Kibo Huts, and 120 bunk beds at Horombo Hut.\\nDouble layered mats provided by your trekking company will put you to sleep in no time.\\nBreakfast, lunch and dinner are prepared during the trek. Your trekking company is bringing their own cook. Don’t be surprised when you see an exclusive three course dinner on your plate.\\nDuring the trek you won’t have a shortage on drinking water.\\nDon’t expect an extensive shower, but there will be the possibility to use hot water for a decent wash.\\nThe guides carry an altitude sickness kit to monitor your pulse rate, oxygen saturation and heart rate twice a day (very useful for monitoring the symptoms of altitude sickness (AMS) at altitude). Also emergency portable oxygen is carried along. On top of that the guides are qualified Wilderness First Responders.\\nThe fees for the Kilimanjaro Rescue Team are covered. This is managed by KINAPA, Kilimanjaro National Parks. Interesting fact: Kinapa means “We carry each other” in Swahili.\\nThe park entry fees, the crater fee, camping fee and value added tax are included in the price.\\nPer person you generally have a team of 1 guide, 1 cook and 3 porters who will support you in your climb. If you are part of a group of four, you will be able to enjoy 2 guides, 1 cook and 12 porters. Although there will always be enough hands on deck, the exact amount of support staff varies per trekking company.\\nVisas are required for all visitors, and cost about $50. For most nationalities it is possible to get a visa upon arrival when you arrive at the airport in Tanzania. Check with your local Tanzanian embassy or consulate to see what the requirements are.\\nThe total amount is also exclusive of flights to and from Tanzania. To get an idea of which airlines are visiting Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA), it is best to have a look at their website.\\nYour international travel insurance is your own responsibility. It is important that your travel insurance also covers adventures at a high altitude. Discuss your itinerary with the insurance company before you travel to Tanzania.\\nTips for guides and porters are exclusive. You decide what you want to tip, but be generous and read our blog post about tipping when you are planning go trekking in Tanzania.\\nWhether you stay in Moshi, Arusha or anywhere else, before and after the trek you have to take care of your own accommodation and meals.\\nWhile the intention is to stick to the described route, a certain degree of flexibility is built in. In some cases it may be necessary to change the route here and there. The mountains are full of surprises, and the weather on Mount Kilimanjaro is unpredictable. The guides continuously carry out risk assessments throughout the expedition. It is therefore best to plan a number of extra days in Tanzania to cover for possible unforeseen circumstances. Read all about altitude sickness here.\\nUnless you are choosing the Marangu Route, you will be staying in durable tents that are equipped for all weather situations. A few porters will always trek ahead of you to make sure that your tent is ready when you arrive. There will also be tables and chairs. Accommodation comes with freshly prepared meals. Every campsite has a long drop toilet. Along the trek you can find your private space behind a rock. Read all about camping on the Kilimanjaro here.\\nDo you reach Uhuru Peak or not? There is a chance that you won’t. Often this depends on the unpredictable weather on the mountain. However, it can also depend on your own physical condition.\\nDo you enjoy hiking, have you gone trekking at higher altitudes and do you exercise twice a week on average? With a little extra training, you are soon fit to challenge Mount Kilimanjaro.\\nIs this the first time that you are trekking at altitude? Make sure you are well prepared. This is important for your safety, but also for that of your team. Make sure you start six months in advance with an hour’s walk or hike twice a week. Read this blog post and get fit for your Kilimanjaro ascent.\\nTrekking in Kilimanjaro requires decent gear. Especially the basics like an 80-90l backpack and quality trekking socks. Also make sure to check our ultimate packing list for trekking Kilimanjaro.\\n– Duffel bag, (waterproof recommended) for porters to carry your equipment.\\nBecause Mount Kilimanjaro covers a relatively large surface area and a lot of elevation, the mountain has more or less its own climate. Responsible for the weather patterns around Mount Kilimanjaro are trade winds that bring along moist from the Indian Ocean. Because of these trade winds, the months of March, April, May and November are the wettest. The southern mountain slopes are especially rainy in these months. From January to March there is a greater chance to see snow on and around the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. This can be experienced as negative, but it will any case be much quieter on the trails. Although these are the coldest months, snowfall and cold temperatures can be expected from December to May. The most suitable and most popular season for climbing Kilimanjaro is from June to October. In these months you can choose any route without having to worry about rain too much. If you want a comfortable route during the rainy season, you best choose the Rongai Route, approaching Kilimanjaro from the North. Due to the differences in altitude and the associated climate zones, it is difficult to estimate the temperatures.\\nTrekking on Kilimanjaro is hard, both for yourself and your support staff. Per person you have a team who will support you in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. This team usually consists of a guide, three porters and a cook. This way you don’t have to carry your full gear yourself. The guide speaks English and usually the rest of the team speaks English as well. You can make things more interesting by learning a few words of Swahili in advance.\\nBookatrekking.com strives to only work with providers who treat porters in a fair manner. Without porters, there is no trekking on Kilimanjaro. They are the heart and soul of your adventure and every day, they carry part of your gear. Bookatrekking.com always tries to find a balance between an affordable trekking adventure and the fair treatment of porters. Read everything about porters on Kilimanjaro here.\\nIt is impossible to climb the Mount Kilimanjaro solo. This means that every climber has his or her own team. Both the guide, the assistant guide, the porter and the cook expect a tip. For the whole trek, this sums up to an amount ranging from USD 330 to USD 450. This is per climber, which means that the amount will not be smaller if the group is larger. Be generous. Read our extensive blog about tipping on Mount Kilimanjaro.\\nThe currency of Tanzania is the Shilling. We recommend you bring US dollars or Euros to cover the costs of your visa, extra travel, and other. It is easiest to travel in Tanzania with US dollars, but credit cards are also accepted in most places. Before you travel, check with your bank whether your credit or debit card can also be used in Tanzania.\\nVisa are required for all visitors, and cost about $50. It is possible to get a visa-on arrival when you arrive at the airport in Tanzania. Look here at the website of the embassy for arranging your visa.\\nTanzania is an area where yellow fever occurs and therefore we recommend you to be vaccinated. We also recommend that you have all other vaccinations such as Tetanus, Diphtheria, Polio and Hepatitis A & B up to date. Malaria is present in Tanzania but there are no mosquitoes at high altitude.

If you are going to stay here you are going to have quite the amount of pocket change but if you can afford it I highly recommend it.\\nThe location is ideal with many grocery stores nearby including a Whole Foods. The concierge are friendly, quick and at your service 24/7. It’s definitely nice when you travel as much as I do when you can go to a grocery store then cook* a meal for yourself in your own kitchen with every utensil imaginable. It is then doubly nice when you realize you don’t have any salt and the concierge brings you a huge container of it in the blink of an eye.\\nMy master suite in the apartment had a comfortable king sized bed, flat screen TV, lots of closet/storage space as well as a large window with a view of the neighbourhood. This apartment was so large that I am pretty sure had I been staying with someone else that they could have been yelling in the living room and I wouldn’t have heard them all the way in the master bedroom. Extremely spacious.\\nThe master suite also had its own bathroom with two double sinks, a bidet, towel warmer, tub/shower and more of the great smelling bath products that the Cheval properties always have. It is nice that they set you up with amenities just as if it was a hotel, the little things like a towel warmer and quality bath products really make a place and bring it together for me.\\nThe second bedroom was a great size as well and its beds could be separated into two single beds if needed. It also had its own full sized bathroom with bidet, warming rack, tub and shower.\\nExtras in the property include a powder room, great for if you have visitors to entertain keeping them out of your main bathroom. Also one of the things that I love most about Cheval Residences is that you don’t come into the apartment empty-handed without any food. The property provides you with a few essentials so that you don’t have to run out to the store right away. Various apartments that I have stayed in have provided me with bread, butter, milk, water, tea, coffee, biscuits, popcorn and granola.\\nAnother great thing about the Cheval Residences is that they don’t skimp on appliances in the kitchen either. There is always a washer and dryer combo, dishwasher, full sized fridge, coffee maker, tea kettle, stove and oven as well as toasters, coffee makers and more. The drawers are also full of all of the utensils necessary.\\nLastly my penthouse suite also had a large living room and a separate dining room area. Just imagine the parties that you could have in this place.

She says she will remain in New York City until her son finishes the school year.\\nSo, how did the White House Easter Egg Roll go this year?\\nJust fine, early reports say.\\nAbout 21,000 children and their families received tickets to this year’s event. They came in small groups to the lawn near the president’s house.

Researchers studying amphibian communities in natural wetland ecosystems as well as controlled experiments have shown that as diversity increased, infection rates dropped.\\nThe rate of extinction of species is increasing as ecosystems across the world come under pressure from habitat loss, pollution and climate change. Recently, changes in biodiversity have been linked to changes in disease risk for humans and wildlife.\\nIn the last ten years, a number of studies have reported a correlation between the species diversity within a community and the ability of diseases to spread among that community. This is because some pathogens, i.e. infectious viruses or bacteria, can infect many different species, which differ in their ability to pass on the disease. The authors of this study set out to test the underlying connection between biodiversity and disease prevalence.\\nOver three years, they observed the spread of Ribeiroia ondatrae, a pathogen that causes severe deformities and death in amphibians, within 345 wetland ecosystems across a 758,100-hectare region of California, USA.\\nA total of 24,215 amphibians were assessed for deformities. In wetlands with low species diversity, the proportion of amphibians carrying and passing on the pathogen was much higher than in those wetlands with a more diverse composition of species. The greater the diversity of species in the wetland ecosystems studied, the higher the number of species more resistant to the pathogen.\\nTransmission of the pathogen was 78.4% lower in the in the most species-diverse wetland communities, compared with the least species-diverse. Under laboratory conditions, the researchers observed a 64% decrease in pathogen transmission and infection when the number of species in a controlled community was increased from one to three. In a further experiment using an outdoor, artificially assembled community, total infection rates decreased by 50% when the number of species present was increased from one to four.\\nThe study provides evidence of a link between biodiversity and the spread of disease. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that there is plenty of evidence to show that populations with little biodiversity, such as monocultures, facilitate the spread of disease. However, the authors also caution that many other environmental factors, including resource availability, climate and habitat variables will interact to affect the rate of spread of disease within a community.\\nThe authors conclude higher levels of biodiversity could help to increase the resilience of wildlife, domestic plants and animals and humans to disease. Conservation efforts should aim to protect and enhance genetic and species diversity as a novel and cost-effective tool in the management of the spread of disease.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-20T09:07:43Z', 'url': 'http://www.sustainapedia.com/increase-biodiversity-decrease-the-spread-of-disease/'}\n","{'text': 'Posted by: ashleyn002@gmail.com, on 1/26/2017, in category \"General news & articles\"\\nPipes carry many types of fluids including liquids and gases from one location to another. Piping systems are often designed for extreme high or low temperatures. However, both hot and cold applications will expand and contract with an increase or decrease in temperature. Installing expansion joints in a piping system prevents thermal expansion from creating high stresses that could cause cracking welds, bending pipes and failing anchors. Composition and Function: Expansion joints are constructed with metal bellows or Teflon, end fittings and accessories such as flow liners, tie rods, and protective shrouds. Most expansion joints are made up of several coils designed to withstand the internal pressure of the system. The common bellows assembly is positioned to flex under the thermal movement of the connected piping. Expansion joints are able to absorb any longitudinal loads as a result of extreme flexibility. To maintain the overall stability of the whole piping system while transferring longitudinal loads, it is necessary to install piping anchors and guides. Thermal Expansion and Placement: Pipes are not an exception when it comes to expansion and contraction with hot and cold temperatures. Piping engineers are able to determine the rate of expansion resulting from the materials and temperatures used for the specific application. After the amount of expansion is known, locations of expansion joints, anchors and guides can be determined and installed. If you are considering expansion joints for a piping system and need assistance with selection or ordering, contact our team at MKS.

When hot it is an oxidizing agent, the sulfur in it being reduced; sulfur dioxide gas may be released. Hot concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with most metals and with several nonmetals, e.g., sulfur and carbon. Because the concentrated acid has a fairly high boiling point, it can be used to release more volatile acids from their salts, e.g., when sodium chloride (NaCl), or common salt, is heated with concentrated sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride gas, HCl, is evolved.\\nConcentrated sulfuric acid has a very strong affinity for water. It is sometimes used as a drying agent and can be used to dehydrate (chemically remove water from) many compounds, e.g., carbohydrates. It reacts with the sugar sucrose, C12H22O11, removing eleven molecules of water, H2O, from each molecule of sucrose and leaving a brittle spongy black mass of carbon and diluted sulfuric acid. The acid reacts similarly with skin, cellulose, and other plant and animal matter.\\nWhen the concentrated acid mixes with water, large amounts of heat are released; enough heat can be released at once to boil the water and spatter the acid.

Since it is dibasic (i.e., it has two replaceable hydrogen atoms in each molecule), it forms both normal sulfates (with both hydrogens replaced, e.g., sodium sulfate, Na2SO4) and acid sulfates, also called bisulfates or hydrogen sulfates (with only one hydrogen replaced, e.g., sodium bisulfate, NaHSO4).\\nchemical compound, SO2, a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor.

The sulfur dioxide is obtained by burning sulfur, by burning pyrites (iron sulfides), by roasting nonferrous sulfide ores preparatory to smelting, or by burning hydrogen sulfide gas. Some sulfuric acid is also made from ferrous sulfate waste solutions from pickling iron and steel and from waste acid sludge from oil refineries.\\nIn the lead chamber process hot sulfur dioxide gas enters the bottom of a reactor called a Glover tower where it is washed with nitrous vitriol (sulfuric acid with nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2, dissolved in it) and mixed with nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide gases; some of the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide and dissolved in the acid wash to form tower acid or Glover acid (about 78% H2SO4). From the Glover tower a mixture of gases (including sulfur dioxide and trioxide, nitrogen oxides, nitrogen, oxygen, and steam) is transferred to a lead-lined chamber where it is reacted with more water. The chamber may be a large, boxlike room or an enclosure in the form of a truncated cone. Sulfuric acid is formed by a complex series of reactions; it condenses on the walls and collects on the floor of the chamber. There may be from three to twelve chambers in a series; the gases pass through each in succession. The acid produced in the chambers, often called chamber acid or fertilizer acid, contains 62% to 68% H2SO4. After the gases have passed through the chambers they are passed into a reactor called the Gay-Lussac tower where they are washed with cooled concentrated acid (from the Glover tower); the nitrogen oxides and unreacted sulfur dioxide dissolve in the acid to form the nitrous vitriol used in the Glover tower. Remaining waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere.\\nIn the contact process, purified sulfur dioxide and air are mixed, heated to about 450°C;, and passed over a catalyst; the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide. The catalyst is usually platinum on a silica or asbestos carrier or vanadium pentoxide on a silica carrier. The sulfur trioxide is cooled and passed through two towers. In the first tower it is washed with oleum (fuming sulfuric acid, 100% sulfuric acid with sulfur trioxide dissolved in it). In the second tower it is washed with 97% sulfuric acid; 98% sulfuric acid is usually produced in this tower. Waste gases are usually discharged into the atmosphere. Acid of any desired concentration may be produced by mixing or diluting the products of this process.\\nSulfuric acid is one of the most important industrial chemicals. More of it is made each year than is made of any other manufactured chemical; more than 40 million tons of it were produced in the United States in 1990. It has widely varied uses and plays some part in the production of nearly all manufactured goods. The major use of sulfuric acid is in the production of fertilizers, e.g., superphosphate of lime and ammonium sulfate. It is widely used in the manufacture of chemicals, e.g., in making hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfate salts, synthetic detergents, dyes and pigments, explosives, and drugs. It is used in petroleum refining to wash impurities out of gasoline and other refinery products. Sulfuric acid is used in processing metals, e.g., in pickling (cleaning) iron and steel before plating them with tin or zinc. Rayon is made with sulfuric acid. It serves as the electrolyte in the lead-acid storage battery commonly used in motor vehicles (acid for this use, containing about 33% H2SO4 and with specific gravity about 1.25, is often called battery acid).\\nAlthough sulfuric acid is now one of the most widely used chemicals, it was probably little known before the 16th cent. It was prepared by Johann Van Helmont (c.1600) by destructive distillation of green vitriol (ferrous sulfate) and by burning sulfur. The first major industrial demand for sulfuric acid was the Leblanc process for making sodium carbonate (developed c.1790). Sulfuric acid was produced at Nordhausen from green vitriol but was expensive. A process for its synthesis by burning sulfur with saltpeter (potassium nitrate) was first used by Johann Glauber in the 17th cent. and developed commercially by Joshua Ward in England c.1740. It was soon superseded by the lead chamber process, invented by John Roebuck in 1746 and since improved by many others. The contact process was originally developed c.1830 by Peregrine Phillips in England; it was little used until a need for concentrated acid arose, particularly for the manufacture of synthetic organic dyes.\\nH2 SO4, a strong dibasic acid corresponding to the highest oxidation state of sulfur (+ 6). Under usual conditions, sulfuric acid is a heavy, oily, colorless, and odorless liquid. In industry, mixtures of sulfuric acid both with water and sulfur trioxide are also called sulfuric acid. If the SO3: H2 O molecular ratio is less than 1, the mixture is an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid; if it is more than 1, the mixture is a solution of SO3 in sulfuric acid.\\nThe compounds H2 SO4·SO3 (H2 S2 O7, disulfuric, or pyrosulfuric acid, mp 35.15°C) and H2 SO4·2SO3 (H2 S3 O10, trisulfuric acid, mp 1.20°C) are also formed. Only water vapor is given off into the vapor phase upon heating and boiling aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid containing up to 70 percent H2 S04. Vapors of sulfuric acid are formed above more concentrated solutions. A solution of 98.3 percent H2 SO4 (azeotropic mixture) upon boiling (336.5°C) is completely distilled. Sulfuric acid containing more than 98.3 percent H2 SO4 releases vapors of SO3 upon heating.\\nSulfuric acid removes water that is chemically bound to organic compounds containing OH, or hydroxyl, groups. The dehydration of ethyl alcohol in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid results in the formation of ethylene or diethyl ether. The charring of sugar, cellulose, starch, and other carbohydrates upon contact with sulfuric acid also derives from the dehydration of these substances. As a dibasic acid, sulfuric acid forms two types of salts: sulfates and bisulfates.\\nProduction. The first descriptions of oil of vitriol, that is, concentrated sulfuric acid, were given by the Italian scientist V. Biringuccio in 1540 and the German alchemist whose works were published under the name of Basilius Valentinus in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1690, the French chemists N. Lemery and N. Lefebvre had laid the basis for the first industrial method of obtaining sulfuric acid, a method applied in England in 1740. According to this method, a mixture of sulfur and saltpeter was burned in a ladle suspended in a glass jar containing a certain amount of water. The SO3 generated reacted with the water to form sulfuric acid. In 1746, J. Roebuck in Birmingham replaced the glass jars with chambers made of sheet lead, thus laying the basis for the chamber process for the production of sulfuric acid. Continuous improvement in the process for the production of sulfuric acid in Great Britain and France resulted in 1908 in the first tower system. In the USSR, the first tower installation went into operation in 1926 at the Po-levskoi Metallurgical Plant in the Urals.\\nThe raw material for the production of sulfuric acid can be sulfur, pyrite (FeS2), or exhaust gases containing SO2 from furnaces for the oxidative roasting of the sulfide ores of Cu, Pb, Zn, and other metals. In the USSR, most sulfuric acid is obtained from pyrite. Here, the FeS2 is burned in furnaces in the state of a fluidized bed, a state achieved by blowing a rapid stream of air through a layer of finely ground pyrite. The gaseous mixture obtained contains SO2, O2, N2, impurities of SO3, and vapors of H2 O, As2 O3, and SiO2 and holds considerable cinder dust, which is removed from the gas in electrostatic precipitators.\\nThe NO produced is converted into N2 O3, or, more precisely, a mixture of NO and NO2, in the oxidizing tower. The gases are then introduced into absorption towers, where they encounter sulfuric acid supplied from the top. It is here that nitrous vitriol is obtained; the mixture is then transferred to the production towers. Thus, there is continuous production and a circulation of nitrogen oxides. The inevitable losses of nitrogen oxides with the exhaust gases are balanced by the addition of HNO3.\\nThe sulfuric acid produced by the nitrous method is of insufficient concentration and contains harmful impurities, for example. As. Production is accompanied by the release of nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere (“foxtails,” named for the color of NO2).\\nDepending on the amount of water introduced into the process, either oleum or a solution of sulfuric acid in water is obtained.\\nIn 1973 the production of sulfuric acid (in the monohydrate) was (in millions of tons): 14.9 in the USSR, 28.7 in the United States, 7.1 in Japan, 5.5 in the Federal Republic of Germany, 4.4 in France, 3.9 in Great Britain, 3.0 in Italy, 2.9 in Poland, 1.2 in Czechoslovakia, 1.1 in the German Democratic Republic, and 0.9 in Yugoslavia.\\nUSE. Sulfuric acid is one of the most important products of the heavy chemical industry. The available grades include chamber acid (not less than 75 percent H2 SO4), oil of vitriol (not less than 92.5 percent), and oleum, or fuming sulfuric acid (a solution of 18.5–20 percent SO3 in H2 SO4), as well as especially pure battery acid (92–94 percent; when diluted by water to 26–31 percent, it serves as the electrolyte in lead batteries). In addition, reagent-grade sulfuric acid (92–94 percent) is produced by the contact process in quartz or platinum apparatus. The strength of sulfuric acid is determined by the density, which is measured with a hydrometer. Most of the chamber acid is used in the production of mineral fertilizers. Sulfuric acid is used in the production of, for example, phosphoric, hydrochloric, boric, and hydrofluoric acids because of its ability to displace these acids from their salts. Concentrated sulfuric acid is used in separating organosulfur compounds and unsaturated organic compounds from petroleum products. Dilute sulfuric acid is used for the removal of scale from wire and sheets before plating with tin or zinc and for the pickling of metal surfaces before plating with chromium, nickel, or copper. It is used in metallurgy for the decomposition of complex ores, in particular, those of uranium. In organic synthesis, concentrated sulfuric acid is a necessary component of nitrating mixtures and a sulfonating agent in the production of many dyes and pharmaceuticals. Owing to its high hygroscopicity, sulfuric acid is used in drying gases and in concentrating nitric acid.\\nSafety measures. Poisonous gases—SO2 and NO2—as well as vapors of SO3 and H2 SO4, present a danger in the production of sulfuric acid. Proper ventilation and hermetically sealed production apparatus are therefore mandatory. Since sulfuric acid causes serious burns of the skin, handling requires extreme care and protective devices (goggles, rubber gloves, aprons, boots). When diluting sulfuric acid, the acid must be poured into water in a thin stream while stirring. Pouring the water into the acid leads to spattering because of the evolution of a great amount of heat.\\nSpravochnik sernokislotchika, 2nd ed. Edited by K. M. Malin. Moscow, 1971.\\nMalin, K. M., N.

We’re talking about your baseboards. They’re on nearly every wall, in every room of your home. So, you’ve probably wondered how to clean white baseboards, or really any color baseboards, at least once in your life. It’s something we’ve addressed for you in this guide. In it we show you the easiest way to clean baseboards by breaking down the cleaning steps into varying levels of difficulty and commitment. So, whether you’re actually looking for the easiest way to clean baseboards or are searching for something a little more involved, we have you covered.\\nNo matter what path you choose, you need a plan of action for how to clean your baseboards. Because they’re in every room, you might go crazy if you try to clean every single baseboard in your home in one session. We suggest starting simply and tackling them one room at a time. And once you’re done actually cleaning the baseboards, you’ll realize what a big difference cleaning that little area can make.\\nFirst things first, make sure cleaning the baseboards is last on your cleaning list. We suggest doing this because cleaning agitates dirt and debris in your home, and eventually it will accumulate along the baseboards of your home. This means if you start with them, you’ll end up cleaning twice. Or even worse, you may end up with baseboards that are dirtier than when you started cleaning. Once all the other cleaning is done, grab your vacuum and its attachments. Use the crevice tool on your vacuum to clean along baseboards and into the corners where all that pet hair and dirt loves to gather. If you find that a few passes of your vacuum's crevice tool is not enough, this is where the power of steam can really shine to tackle those down low messes.\\nIf you’re not familiar with our PowerFresh® Slim Steam Mop, prepare to be amazed. This machine lets you take the natural cleaning power of steam on and above your floors in multiple ways. When it comes to cleaning baseboards, there are two specific ways you can use this machine to your benefit. First, if you detach the foot, it becomes an extended reach surface cleaner, meaning you can steam clean baseboards without having to get on your hands and knees. The steam mop also converts into a portable handheld steam cleaner with an on-hand tool kit, allowing you to carry tools and switch them out as you clean. Plus, if you’re worried about how to clean wood baseboards safely, our steam machines are safe on sealed wood. However, we still recommend you test your steamer in an inconspicuous spot along your baseboards to make sure the steam doesn’t damage them.\\nDid you know you should also clean near the very bottom of baseboards where they meet your carpets? Our DeepClean DeluxeTM Pet is engineered with EdgeSweep® Bristles that do exactly what their name claims – they sweep debris along the edges of rooms while you’re cleaning your carpets. Then, just be sure to follow the steps below, so they can really shine.\\nAre you looking for a last-minute solution for the best way to clean baseboards with things you already have in your home? We can help with that too. For this method, all you need is a bucket, water, some dish soap, and a sponge. Mix warm water and the soap together in a bucket and wash the baseboards by hand. This gives you the opportunity to get up close and personal to any dirt that may be on your baseboards and give any areas that are particularly dirty a good scrub. After you’ve cleaned them with soap and water, feel free to dry the baseboards with a towel.\\nWhile you’re washing your baseboards by hand, you may notice the corners are particularly dirty. Don’t worry, you’re probably the only person that’s seen the dirt that up close. And what’s better, cleaning the corners is pretty easy. We recommend using a cotton swab as a baseboard cleaning tool to wipe out that hard-to-reach dirt. If you’re using the PowerFresh Slim Steam Mop, you may also consider using the bristle scrub brush attachment to steam clean those baseboard corners.\\nThe finishing touch on cleaning baseboards is almost as quick as a trip to your laundry room. This is one of our favorite tricks. In fact, it may be the best baseboard cleaner tip out there. We’re happy we get to share it with you! Grab a dryer sheet and take it into the room where you’re cleaning baseboards. Rub the dryer sheet all along the baseboards. This simple task actually helps repel pet hair and dust from baseboards, so they stay cleaner, longer. And that means you won’t have to clean your baseboards as often.\\nWe hope these tips helped you find an easy answer to the popular question, how to clean baseboards, in a way that fits your busy schedule!\", 'timestamp': '2019-04-23T10:49:36Z', 'url': 'https://www.bissell.com/blog/best-way-to-clean-baseboards'}\n","{'text': 'The Gola Active Lupus is a lightweight infants’ trainer that is perfect for fast-paced fun activities.

They are a compound movement that hits almost every muscle in the body. Those looking to increase the amount of weight they lift off the ground should look to different variations of the movement to help strengthen weak points.\\nWhen lifting heavy, there are two common areas of difficulty; grip strength and lat strength.\\nAs you start to move towards the ground, the bar should stay close to the body, by using the lats. If the lats are not strong enough, the upper back can start to round, leading to rounding of the lower back(not good). The bar should travel in a straight line at all times to minimize the distance the bar moves.\\nGrip strength is also necessary to control the bar on the way up and back down towards the ground. Lack of grip strength can cause compensations in your lower back, especially as the weight gets heavy.\\nAlong with doing work that isolates the lats and grip, you should also do movements that mimic the deadlift but allow you to build strength on weak points. In a RDL, the bar starts at the top and you lower the bar but only until just below the knee. During the entire lift, you need to maintain proper control and since the bar never reaches the ground, it challenges your grip and lat strength in a great way.\\nPosition the bar at about mid-thigh height.\\nWalk up and place your hands on the bar just outside of your thigs.\\nPosition your feet around hip width apart with your toes pointed forward.\\nSqueeze your shoulder blades together and load your hips as you bring the bar down to just below your knees.\\nYou should feel tension in the hamstrings and glutes at this point.\\nRaise the bar back up to starting position.\\nNote: The bar never travels to the floor, the reason is that you want to keep max tension on the hamstrings. Your back is also neutral for the entire lift.\\nThis is great movement to add into your workoutsto help work on weak points in your deadlift. It can be done after your regular deadlifts or on a separate day.\\nCheck out this great video from Brett Contreras on how to do an RDL (0:36-1:28).', 'timestamp': '2019-04-22T05:57:23Z', 'url': 'http://fittag.com/news/deadlift-variation/'}\n","{'text': 'CEOs and CFOs of private or closely held businesses engage us for audit, tax, employee benefit, and advisory services, to help owners manage their business.

What started out small has now led to several yearly trips to countries around the world. Recently, our team was able to complete the 100th short-term medical and dental outreach in Zambia. Here are some of the lives you were able to impact in the span of just one day!\\nOscar came to our medical tent reporting that he was randomly falling down every month. Just the night before, he had fallen down and sustained a traumatic injury to his right arm. The doctor said that it was the type of fracture that could have very easily severed his main artery in his arm. After Oscar’s examination, it was determined that he had a seizure disorder. Unfortunately, he had no way of getting to the hospital for treatment, so we paid for his transport. By diagnosing his disorder, our team hoped he could avoid future injuries to his body.\\nSweet Grace came to our outreach hunched over and suffering for aches that most 89-year-olds would experience. However, she did not have the simple medicines available to help. Our team was able to give her aspirin, blood pressure medicine and pills for her muscles; such simple solutions to the pain she was feeling. Our team was also happy to pray with Grace before she left; “Now after prayer, I feel that my body has become normal. It doesn’t feel as badly as before.” She left standing much straighter!\\n67-year-old Alex had been having trouble with his eyes for at least two years. He was not able to see clearly, and which caused him difficulty when reading. After meeting with one of our volunteers, he received a pair of glasses and was so ecstatic to be able to read again. What was the first book he picked up? One of Joyce’s from the prayer tent!\\nWe’ve been able to treat 297,923 patients and see 106,056 salvations over the course of 100 trips, but there are so many more lives to reach!

It was great, but definitely very time consuming. With summer upon us, I was excited to do a fun, interactive but less intensive mini history course.\\nWe received the Make-a-State Activity-Pak as a downloadable resource, but there is a CD version as well. It’s intended for grades three through eight, but with a bit of help from me, my first grader was able to do the activities, too. The Activity-Pak contains instructions and printables for 20 projects that you can put together into one big Lap Book. The activities include key state facts, a state timeline, recipes, state geography and government, and much more.\\nA nice thing about this resource is that you can use it for any state, so while we began with a study of our home state of Texas we can use it again later for other states, too. And of course we can pick and choose what all we want to use, so we can do just a few activities if we want to just touch on a state rather than learning ALL about it. And actually, because I’m using this for first and fourth grade rather than third through eighth, I’m not doing every activity in our Texas study, either.\\nThe materials include a set of State Pages with some brief information to use for your key facts and such, but otherwise lets you choose where to pull information from to complete the activities. It also includes a bonus “Name That State!” File Folder Game that can familiarize kids with the shape and location of states, capital cities, and more.\\nSo, I thought at the beginning that we would go through and do 100% of every activity exactly as instructed and just have a blast learning about Texas this summer, but it turns out that I am just not very good at doing big projects, and this one was actually a lot more work than I realized it would be. In all honestly, I think I like the idea of hands on schoolwork more than the actual implementation of doing all the tasks.

For example, we chose to not bother at all with cutting out a recipe card and coloring and putting together a piece of the Lap Book for that, because it’s not something my girls cared about at all.

O’Connor used her religion and the manner she viewed Christianity to pervade her narratives and deliver messages she believed to be the most equal manner to maneuver others of the same or similar religion in the right way. Her upbringing, her environment, and the manner she lived her life had an exponential correlativity with her religion and the manner she tied it into the short narratives mentioned. You perilously word all the information above this bolded country in such a manner that suggests you knew O’Connor. In the bolded country, though, you claim something you can non cognize without reading a beginning, which means you either accidentally plagiarized or you made a headlong claim. One is illegal, and the other is unethical. Besides, retrieve how we can non hold any beginning information in our thesis statement, subject sentences, or decision. Though some claim that her messages are difficult to understand, or may even be misunderstood, her beliefs are still in the Hagiographas themselves. Her characters frequently seem to be missing in religion, or oppugning their religion during the class of each narrative. The words and lines they speak in each piece of literature all have a spiritual significance behind them. Flannery O’Connor expressed spiritual political orientation throughout her short narratives “ Good State Peoples ” and “ A Good Man is Difficult to Find. ” You need to state throughout her authorship. We can discourse why subsequently.\\nNeed to bind all subject sentences to O’Connor. In “ A Good Man is Difficult to Find, ” the character The Misfit expressed his uncertainty over the instructions of Jesus and God when discoursing with the grandma. He said things refering to the idea of losing his religion after he was incarcerated in the penitentiary ( O’Connor, “ Good Man ” 375-377 ) . He claimed “ It was the same instance with Him as with me except He had n’t committed any offense and they could turn out that I had committed oneaˆ¦ ” ( O’Connor, “ Good Man ” 376 ) . He believed that no affair what he did, he would be punished. O’Connor most likely believed that adult male will ever confront what he has done one time he comes before concluding judgement. The Misfit mentions Jesus and the manner he threw everything off balance by raising the dead. He claimed that if Jesus truly performed this action, so there was no other pick but to follow his words and instructions. The Misfit besides suggested that if what is said about Jesus were to be false, so there was nil else you could make but do the most of your life while you can. His word pick was much more colourful, imputing to his character and the manner he lived ( O’Connor “ Good Man ” 375-377 ) . The Misfit ‘s actions in the narrative besides coincide with the manner O’Connor perceived God. She stated of God, “ aˆ¦God is non accepted by work forces, so they have to be shocked into a acknowledgment of their demand for him ” ( Mayer 5 ) . The pick of words The Misfit uses during his discoursing with the grandma is to a great extent declarative to the writer ‘s background. Such things are frequently suggested by those of the Roman Catholic religion, the religion that Flannery O’Connor herself followed proudly and stated many times through interviews ( Liukkonen ) .\\nTwo old ages after composing “ A Good adult male is Difficult to Find, ” O’Connor wrote “ Good State Peoples, ” showing her positions over the difference in the symbol of the Satan and the darkness of life. When she was asked about the relation between the prankster character Manley Pointer, a immature adult male who posed as a bible salesman, and the Satan, she responded that his character was showing the “ psychological inclination ” ( Hawkes 397 ) I ‘ve pointed out several times that MLA does non let for mentioning in the center of the text. See Purdue Owl. that we see as the darkness of life. When Pointer foremost appears in the narrative, he claims to be a low retainer of Christianity selling Bibles that did n’t want to travel to college due to a bosom status. But as the narrative progresses he tricks Hulga and takes her unreal leg. He even claims that he had done such things several times before in other towns ( O’Connor, “ State Peoples ” 390-391 Shorten the rubric and merely state “ Country ” and go forth the writer and page figure. See Purdue Owl. ) . The prankster character is frequently a pretense for the Satan in many narratives and fabrications throughout Christian instructions. Though one could reason Pointer was a literary incarnation of the Satan, Flannery dismissed this thought. Pointer was simply one who preyed on the faithful for his ain addition ( Hawkes 399 ) . Pointer stated that he had “ been believing in nil of all time since I was born ” ( O’Connor, “ State Peoples ” 391 ) . This character embodies the position that those without religions are lost and merely looking for personal addition. Hulga ‘s character in the narrative was an atheist, much to the discouragement of her female parent, Mrs. Hopewell. Mrs. Hopewell was n’t portrayed as a devout Christian, but she did transport the beliefs and ethical motives of the religion. It even stated that her personal Bible was perchance in the Attic someplace ( O’Connor, “ State Peoples ” 383 ) . The belief that seems to be common between the characters in the narrative “ Good State Peoples ” and O’Connor herself is that if you are in fact good state people, so everything will be good and that their Godhead will judge them kindly when they leave this universe. O’Connor used this message because she shared the same belief, coming from the people she lived about and was raised by ( Friedman 233 ) .\\nA author ‘s environment and upbringing are ever dominant factors in the manner they portray characters and state of affairss throughout their plants. O’Connor was raised in the “ Bible Belt ” part of rural Georgia and was the lone kid of a strongly Roman Catholic household. Her male parent died of Lupus when she was at a really immature age. Over the class of her life, she acquired her instruction and began composing many southern based narratives and pieces such as the two narratives already discussed. After she was diagnosed with the same disease that killed her male parent, she stayed closed to her household place in Milledgeville, GA and continued authorship, integrating her spiritual beliefs into them with the manner Christians should lodge to their way. The at hand sense of the inevitable strengthened her religion during her ulterior old ages. Once she passed off in 1964 ( “ A Study of Flannery O’Connor ” ) , her plants and peculiar authorship manner were left for everyone to analyse and review. But the contents of all of her Hagiographas still contain messages, ethical motives, and instructions of spiritual political orientation ( Abbott 3-8 ) .', 'timestamp': '2019-04-26T10:27:00Z', 'url': 'https://essaylead.com/good-man-is-hard-to-find-english-literature-essay-794/'}\n","{'text': 'Finance Asia has a report on Asian tidal / ocean current power company Atlantis - Tidal power company moves to the next level.\\nPower generation using tidal currents is the latest renewable energy source to emerge as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. The technology has yet to be deployed commercially, but the unparalleled predictability of the movement and intensity of tides suggests it has clear advantages for the power industry, versus some of the other renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power.\\nAccording to an Atlantis press release, ocean power, which includes tidal current power, wave power and ocean thermal energy conversion, represents a vast source of energy estimated at between 2,000 and 4,000 terawatt hours per year. The US and the UK combined have sufficient ocean power potential to meet around 15% of their power needs.\\nHaving spent 10 years developing its turbines, Cornelius says Atlantis is now ready to become the first tidal power developer to establish mini-arrays (essentially farms or fields of multiple subsea turbines of 1 or 2 megawatts each). This will allow it to aggregate the necessary data about environmental and turbine performance before it moves on to apply for permits for projects of a much more significant scale.\\nThese commercial projects should see the company turn cash flow positive in 2011, he adds.\\nThe company has had a 150KW turbine installed and connected to the grid in Australia since 2006 and is hoping to build up its generation capacity there, but it is also actively looking for several other sites both in Asia and Europe where it can set up trail arrays. It is currently evaluating potential installation opportunities in the Pentland Firth off Northern Scotland, in the Bay of Fundy and in British Columbia off the east and west costs of North America and off the coast of South Korea.\\nChina also has the potential to become a “huge” market, according to Cornelius, since the company’s Nereus turbine that is suitable for shallow-water can be deployed not just in tidal oceans, but in rivers too – and that is a resource that China has a plenty of. Atlantis also has a second type of turbine, the Solon, which is a deep-water turbine that can be installed in some of the fastest flowing currents in the world.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-26T13:45:46Z', 'url': 'http://peakenergy.blogspot.com/2008/09/power-of-atlantis.html'}\n","{'text': \"This was Reinsdorf's reply on Friday when asked whether the preseason announcement that Phil Jackson will not return as coach of the Bulls next season is, as the French saying goes, a fact accomplished.\\nAnd the notation on the desk of Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago Bulls, also indicates his position regarding Michael Jordan's often-stated contention that he will play for no other coach than Jackson, and he will play for no other team than the Bulls, which would mean no Jordan filling up the nets next season.\\nThe Bulls make their final regular-season appearance at Madison Square Garden this afternoon against the Knicks, and it seems inconceivable that Jordan will not return for yet another year, and that neither Jackson nor Scottie Pippen will be with the Bulls, either.\\nJordan, still the world's greatest hoopster, is leading the National Basketball Association in scoring for the 10th time in his 14 seasons. Even at age 35, he is playing as good an all-round game as ever. Fans, players and team executives know this, so it can hardly be lost on Jordan himself.\\nIt is also obvious that His Airness -- a little less airy these days and a little more earthy but ever sovereign -- is having a grand time at his occupation, and satisfying that remarkable lust for competition and success that has made him an indomitable basketball player.\\nJordan has changed his mind before, remember. He quit basketball to play baseball and quit baseball to play basketball.\\nBut hadn't decisions already been made? As recently as early February, Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, reiterated that Jackson would not return next season, after having led the Bulls to five championships and, if the best-laid plans of Krause and his men do not go awry, to a sixth come June.\\nThe personality, or perhaps ego, clash between Jackson and Krause is no secret. While he hired Jackson, Krause also believes that after a certain time, a general manager and a coach may tire of each other, as, has been said, Jerry West and Pat Riley did with the Lakers, thereby compelling a change.\\nIn fact, personality clashes between Krause and some of his players, including Pippen and Jordan, and assistant coaches over the years have been no secret. It seems, however, that Krause has had no such conflict with the owner of the team. But it also seems clear that Reinsdorf has sought for Krause and staff to zipper their lips in regard to what may transpire at season's end.\\nStill, Reinsdorf's respect for Krause as a basketball operative is lofty, and for good reason. Krause became general manager in 1985, the year after Jordan was drafted. Six seasons later, the Bulls won the first of their championships.\\n''Everyone on the first championship team except Jordan was acquired by Krause,'' Reinsdorf said. That included Pippen, astutely attained in a trade for his draft rights and now seemingly headed elsewhere next season as a free agent, although who knows for sure.\\nPippen, who will be 33 in September, doesn't talk to Krause, but he does talk to Reinsdorf. And while Pippen is said to be seeking a huge five-year contract, Reinsdorf said he had yet to hear anything like that from Pippen, who has been bitter about what the Bulls have been paying him but has also been making plenty of money with endorsements.\\nKrause took a chance on Dennis Rodman. He found a place for Steve Kerr. He traded a nonentity, Stacey King, for center Luc Longley. He traveled for years to Europe to court Toni Kukoc, and finally snared him. He saw the possibilities in Ron Harper's career being revived.\\nYes, Krause has had Jordan all this time, but Jordan found that he couldn't do it alone. He didn't win his first championship until his seventh season in the league -- with a requisite ''supporting cast,'' as Jordan termed it.\\nKrause has surely made mistakes, too, such as some draft picks.\\nKrause, meanwhile, sometimes says things without a veneer of suavity. He can rankle in his bluntness, or, sometimes, in his evasiveness. And possibly he is frustrated in not receiving much of the due he believes he deserves.\\nWhen he received his championship ring for last season along with the rest of the team at the season opener at the United Center, the boos for him were evident. It was odd, since if he had been the general manager of five championships in, say, New York, he could be Mayor of this town -- and on a write-in ballot.\\nSo at what point do you make a decision to break up the team?\\nLooking at their history, it is manifest that as a twosome neither Krause nor Reinsdorf is so stupid or driven by ego that he will perpetrate the sublimely imbecilic.\\nThe view here is that Jordan will definitely be playing next season with the Bulls, with or without Jackson. But the odds of Jackson returning appear healthy, as well, especially if the Bulls win another title.\\nIf there is one exception to ''Nothing is written in stone,'' it is this: It's a bottom-line game.\", 'timestamp': '2019-04-18T13:28:45Z', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/08/sports/on-pro-basketball-one-last-hurrah-for-the-bulls-reinsdorf-isn-t-quite-saying.html'}\n","{'text': 'Every year the Denver Film Society is proud to honor the impact of these vibrant cultures with CineLatino, a four-day film festival celebrating the hottest in Latino cinema with exclusive premieres, receptions, and special events.\\nThis year’s programming will have something for cinema lovers of all ages and interests.

(The \"prime rate\" is another frequently used benchmark.) Any adjustable rate loan or other financial product tied to a benchmark will follow that benchmark’s movements up and down.\\nFor example, if the margin (the percentage added to the benchmark rate) on your adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is 1.25% and the LIBOR is 2.5%, your interest rate would be 3.75% (1.25% + 2.50% = 3.75%). In this scenario, if the LIBOR increased a quarter percent, to 2.75%, your new rate would be 4.00% (1.25% + 2.75% = 4.00%). That could be a significant increase on a larger loan, resulting in many thousands of dollars extra interest paid over the life of the loan. Likewise, a lower LIBOR would save you money on interest payments.\\nIf you have a fixed rate loan, the LIBOR does not affect you. If you have an adjustable rate loan, your loan documents, and possibly even your monthly loan statement, will tell you if your rate is tied to the LIBOR. If you can’t find the information there, you can call your loan servicer and ask.\\nIn the \"LIBOR scandal\" of mid-2012, accusations were made that LIBOR had been manipulated by the banks that determine the benchmark\\'s rate, allegedly since the early \\'90s, to either make money or to make their bank and the banking system as a whole appear stronger. Because in that particular instance the interest rates had been manipulated downward, average borrowers with LIBOR mortgages, student loans and other forms of credit most likely benefited from the manipulation. However, some consumer and institutional investors may have experienced lower returns on their money.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-19T14:33:50Z', 'url': 'https://www.consumer-action.org/helpdesk/articles/libor_variable_rate_loan'}\n","{'text': 'You can post for sale and for rent advertisements for free.

Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. From out of the past come the thundering hoof beats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!\"\\nHow many times I must have heard those lines, and how impressive they must have been, to be remembered 70 years later?\\nmeans stupid in Spanish? What did kemo sabe mean? – boss, or pal, or champion of justice, or paleface idiot?\\nWhen I was little, there was no radio in our house; our parents were deaf. Our grandparents had a big table-model Philco in their parlor. Just as kids nowadays tease for an iPhone, I kept asking for a radio until I got it. A tiny, dark-brown Bakelite-cased Arvin, it sat on the sideboard in our dining room.\\nEvery weekday, from 4:45 till 6:00 in the afternoon, I pulled my long-legged chair up to the sideboard, turned on the radio, and gazed at the dial. Many of you must remember \"watching the radio\" and memorizing the numbers of the AM dial, from 520 to 1610 kilohertz. I could tell from the glances I got from my parents as I sat there – sitting still for longer than at any other time in my life – that they suspected I was listening to something inappropriate and possibly sinful.\\nAt 4:45 a voice crackled over a simulated radio transmission: \"CX4 to control tower. CX4 to control tower. Standing by…\" The answer was immediate: \"Control tower to CX4. Wind southeast, ceiling 1200. All clear.\"\\n\"This is Hop Harrigan, coming in!\" So it went: five 15-minute episodes, featuring Jack Armstrong, Captain Midnight; Terry and the Pirates, and finally Tom Mix.\\nEvenings, there were half-hour shows – The Green Hornet; The Shadow, in real life Lamont Cranston, \"wealthy young man-about-town\" who once in the Orient had learned to \"cloud men’s minds so they cannot see him.\"\\nEverything we imagined was the product of our separate minds’ eyes. When the Lone Ranger walked across the board platform of a railroad station, each of us constructed a different scene. It was like the famous \"driveway moments\" on Public Radio; you could do nothing else demanding thought while you were into an on-air drama. Listening to archived recordings now reveals it to have been pretty simplistic drivel. Still, wasn’t it glorious!\\n(TAG) You can find more commentaries by Willem Lange at VPR-dot-net.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-21T20:03:59Z', 'url': 'https://vprarchive.vpr.net/commentary-series/lange-old-radio-days/'}\n","{'text': 'So you want a college degree.\\nIn the USA, about the only acceptable answer is “Chaaa, to get a bitchin’ new Camaro, hombre!” If you are a parent and already have a bitchin’ Camaro, you want your children to go to college so they, too, can afford their own bitchin’ Camaros. Education is just that important! More education, more Camaros.\\nDo you think I’m cynical? Do you think I consider my countrymen to be that crass and — heaven forfend — stupid?\\nWell, yes I am. And yes, yes I do.\\nI’ve based my conclusions on a lifetime of observations of what Americans truly value. It isn’t education, really. We don’t care what kind of low-brow, thick-fingered troglodyte dullard you resemble as long as you have good credit and faithfully participate in consumerism. A college education has traditionally been the best path to full citizenship, where you extract the maximum compensation from a corporation in order to pay for dumb stuff that’s supposed to make you happy and obviously better than others.\\nSo really, I support free college for everyone. I’d like college degrees to be so common that they no longer represent any potential income advantage at all. I’d like to see the market flooded with not only liberal-arts majors, but also engineers, doctors, scientists — everything. At that point, we’ll all be living with mom until we’re 40 while working at Starbucks, and this whole spurious correlation of degree with income will be a distant memory. We’ll get to study whatever we want, and to get back to actually valuing education over GM’s answer to the Ford Mustang.\\nYou with me on this? I hope so.\\nAnyway, when politicians on stage talk about making college more available or even free, some people in their audiences get excited. The people who get excited are people who haven’t yet gone to college, or parents of people who haven’t yet gone. Then, there are those who get resentful. These are the people still making college loan payments.\\nIn the minds of the people who get excited there floats one specific image. It’s not an image of long nights spent inhaling the wisdom buried in books, nor hunched over a laptop writing the one research paper to end all research papers. It’s not an image of long conversations on campus with other seekers, when all come to some new mutual understanding of a truth revealed. It’s not an image of a lifetime spent as an enlightened citizen armed with the knowledge and cognitive tools to make good choices in one’s community and to truly participate in democracy.\\nNo. The image is of a yellow Camaro. With stripes. Just like Bumblebee from Transformers.\\nSo perhaps it’s only just that college not be free after all. It’s not really about education, see. It’s more like a business. Put in your 4-6 years and your $100K-$250K and if you’ve played your cards right, you have income for life. But the only way this can work is if there is some entrance fee.

Scott Balcerek directed this new documentary about an unlikely musical partnership between Sterling ‘Satan’ Magee, a southern-born guitarist and Adam Gussow, a white, younger, Ivy League educated New York suburbanite harmonica player. It traces how Magee, after stints with such greats as Ray Charles, James Brown, King Curtis, got tired of seeing how black artists got exploited and took to the streets of Harlem to play strictly for the people. A chance encounter with Gussow, a grad school drop out and part-time street performer turned into a 12 year collaboration that took from the streets of New York to stages all over the world, a cover story in Living Blues magazine and an appearance in the U2 concert film and soundtrack Rattle & Hum. The doc also covers Gussow’s efforts to reconnect with Magee, who, after suffering a nervous breakdown, stopped performing and all but disappeared, as well as their dramatic return in 2005. Though music plays a formative role , the love and mutual respect they have for each other is what really fuels the film. A doc that will move and inspire.

To work as a full-time, tenure-track educator, you must meet certain requirements and prove that you are skilled and passionate about your role. Tenure offers you great protection in your career but every state and educational system has their own path that you must take. Read on, and find out when a master’s is and is not required.\\nWhat is a Tenure and Why is it So Important?\\nTenure is technically defined as the right to due process so that high schools, colleges and other educational institutions cannot legally fire a teacher or professor without providing evidence that they are not competent or they have been inappropriate, according to the National Education Association. Since evidence must be provided and there is an entire process that school officials must follow, only about 2% of professors on the tenure-track lose their job annually.\\nTo get your tenure, you must complete a probationary period and show that you are professional and competent in your role. While a professor is on probation, it is okay for the seniors in charge of hiring to fire the professor without cause at any time and go with a new faculty contract. The senior professors in charge of evaluation will work with administrators and new non-tenured faculty to evaluate their research capabilities and how they service the classroom to decide if they are deserving of tenure. If there are not recommended for tenure, the professor will lose their job and probation starts over when they begin under a new teaching contract.\\nHow Long Does it Take to Become a Tenured Educator?\\nOnly about one-third of college professors are tenured faculty, and this is a major cause for concern in the field. If you are hired on the tenure-track in a college setting, it typically will take about three years at a junior college and seven years at a four-year college to be granted tenure. If you are working in a high school, middle school or primary school, everything is based on the state law that applies to public schools.\\nSome states have five-year requirements and others have 10-year requirements where all public school teachers are considered ‘on probation’. The average tenure-track duration in the United States is about seven years when you average the laws across the country.\\nYou might assume that getting a graduate degree is the number one way for getting through probation, but that is not always the case. A master’s degree in education will help you strengthen your knowledge on curriculum development, instruction, administration or counseling, but it is not centered around teaching specifically. It is more focused on the educational system than educating your students like a Master’s of Arts in Teaching.\\nOne drawback of having your master’s before you are tenured is that it tempts the school to let go of you and secure a contract with a young, Bachelor’s degree holding teacher who will cost less. If you wait until after you are tenured, the school cannot let you go because you decided to advance your education level.\\nIf you would like to research types of M.Ed. programs that you can take and schools that offer them, it is time to seek out accredited programs. Once you know that you do not need a Master in Education degree to qualify for tenure, start focusing on teaching first and then focus on graduate programs.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-26T10:28:15Z', 'url': 'http://www.masters-degree-in-education.org/faq/do-you-need-a-masters-in-education-degree-to-qualify-for-tenure/'}\n","{'text': 'Since January 1, 2004, all Canadian organizations engaged in commercial activities have been required to comply with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act(“PIPEDA”) and the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information incorporated by reference into PIPEDA.

This is due to the increasing availability of drones and their capabilities of travelling large distances and taking high resolution photographs and videos. From a criminological perspective, drones are an ideal method of smuggling, physically removing the operator from the act. It is for this reason that drones are also being utilised as deadly weapons in conflict areas. The need for forensic research to successfully analyse captured drones is rising. The challenges that drones present include the need to interpret flight data and tackling the multi-platform nature of drone systems. This paper reports the extraction and interpretation of important artefacts found in the recorded flight logs on both the internal memory of the UAV and the controlling application, as well as analysis of media, logs and other important files for identifying artefacts.

The city is both old and new: its history goes all the way back to the 9th century and it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006 for its uniquely well-preserved medieval Old Town. At the same time, the universities make it feel very young! It’s a great place to have grown up.\\nWhere and what you’re studying: I am in the final stages of gaining my Bachelor’s degree in political science and British Studies, having studied in Regensburg and Hong Kong.\\nWhat is one project or activity you enjoyed at the Embassy?\\nBeing an intern in the economics department at the embassy, the tariffs on steel and aluminium introduced by the United States during my time in DC had a great impact on my work: it was fascinating watching the political process at such proximity! I also really appreciated the department itself because it covers such a wide range of topics. For example, I was able to gain insights into farming and agricultural exports, the implications of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the US, but also the challenges of migration and developmental work by visiting various events around the city and aiding colleagues in their research.\\nWhat do you think is one of Germany’s main foreign policy challenges and what should Germany do about it?\\nI can only echo what my fellow interns have mentioned in this section: finding and preserving unity – both domestically and within the EU –, strengthening the transatlantic relationship and tackling the rise of populism around the world are issues that must be taken seriously. Likewise, making sure the art of diplomacy and skilled conversation is not lost in a world where a Tweet travels faster than actions.\\nWhat are some cultural impressions you gained of the United States?\\nI love how open and communicative people are in the US compared to Germany. Every conversation here starts with a “How are you?” – be it a random person on the street or your Uber driver. If you ask cashiers in Germany about their well-being I can guarantee all you will get are strange looks.\\nWhat has been your biggest surprise with regard to living in Washington?\\nI have never been to a place that is more political than DC! This city lives and breathes politics, be it all the government agencies and organizations that are based here, the think tanks and the events they host, or everyday life in general. When you meet somebody here, chances are they work on the Hill, for the World Bank or an NGO. As a student of political science, the atmosphere in this place is a dream!\\nWhat do you miss about Germany?\\nApart from my family, friends and my dog I’d have to say living in a small country! It’s a weird thing to miss, I know. One of the joys of living in Europe is having so many different cultures, languages and traditions in such proximity. A four-hour drive is not considered a quick excursion as it is in the US! One thing I definitely don’t miss, however, is not being able to do your shopping on a Sunday or after 8 pm. That’s one convenience I have come to appreciate a lot and that will be sorely missed when it’s time for me to return home.\\nWhat has been your biggest lesson learnt during your internship?\\nBe prepared for lots and lots of small talk! DC is the capital of networking. I have lost count of the amount of business cards people have given me during the two short months I have been here. Having a few easy topics of conversation on-hand makes life a lot easier!\\nWhat has been your biggest challenge living here?\\nDealing with all the single-use plastic. It is nearly impossible to avoid when doing the weekly shop and often it is utterly superfluous! It should not be possible to buy individually plastic-wrapped potatoes or pre-peeled eggs and oranges in plastic containers, yet these things are readily available at my local grocery store. I am glad, however, that DC has introduced a 5-cent plastic bag fee; it’s definitely a step in the right direction.\\nWhere do you plan to go or what do you plan to do after your internship?\\nSadly, even the most fun internships must end someday… I will be returning home to Regensburg and will be greeted by an exam and term papers before finally finishing by Bachelor’s thesis.

The object is to capture and convey your unique appeal, no matter where we take the photographs. So please reach out to us and we’d be more than happy to provide you with as much information as you need, as well as offering testimonials, so you can decide if we’re the professional photographer service that you would like to carry out your photography work here in Lynn Haven. We look forward to speaking to you soon!\\nWith our significantly growing technical world we live in it’s becoming more regular that we come across people who are debating whether they need to employ a professional photographer. Why not simply take them yourself? Or better yet, have a good friend or family member with a good camera take the photos? Now don’t get me wrong, I enjoy the fact many people have access to technology that can help them photograph their day to day lives; but, when it comes to important events, milestones, business headshots, personal shoots, and your wedding, it is important that you employ a professional! There is a lot more that goes into expert photography than having great equipment … So today, I am sharing with you the TOP SIX REASONS why you ought to think about employing an expert photographer.\\n1) Consistent Results – In my opinion, I think 2 key components of an expert golfer are consistency and versatility. For example, an excellent golfer that plays the regional course twice a week every week, might have the ability to par the course regularly, but that golfer might not be that consistent when having to adapt to an entirely new course and especially a difficult course. but an expert golfer can not only shoot par and way much better in many cases regularly, but they can also adapt to a brand-new course. This is similar to the way an expert photographer works. An expert photographer can be consistent in various scenarios by adapting to the surrounds based upon knowledge. This consistency, adaptability and knowledge are all things that produce quality results from the professional photographer.\\n2) Equipment – Some pros might not agree with me on this, but ask them exactly what they shoot with. You will likely discover that it’s not the most recent low-end consumer DSLR. It’s true that equipment alone does not magically make someone professional photographer. So just to clarify, if someone goes to the camera shop in the morning and spends thousands of dollars, that doesn’t mean she or he is instantly professional. Nevertheless, for those genuinely doing photography as a career, there is typically a significant investment that comes with that career choice. One camera bag might have countless dollars worth of financial investment inside it. You wouldn’t use a professional in other fields that don’t have the right equipment to do the job, so don’t use a photographer who bought a camera, a kit lens and a flash on Saturday and magically Monday morning they are a pro. In the BIG brand name photography world, it’s most likely these photographers will not be going after that business. but small business owner beware, make certain the photographer is equipped to carry out the task and provide exceptional quality.\\n3) It’s Your Brand – Your brand is very important and professional photography is a simple way to make your brand name stand out. It’s true that in the digital age that you or your friend armed with a good camera can get some shots that may be just sufficient for the Internet and look excellent. Nevertheless, with a little financial investment for a true professional photographer, your brand name might go from average to great. Perception is everything. Invest in professional photographer and not someone who just takes good pictures that may just be good enough.\\n4) You Get What You Pay For – OK, you don’t always get exactly what you pay for and in some cases high price is not as good as cheap. Nevertheless, when you are working with a real skilled professional photographer and are really comparing apples to apples, it’s likely that the cheapest photographer out there will not deliver equivalent outcomes. Although the inexpensive photographer could be a philanthropist and be fantastic, it’s likely that too cheap will just yield good outcomes and not excellent ones. A buddy of mine sent me some examples of a professional photographer’s work just recently together with what the photographer desired for the images, I was surprised at the results and the price. Why did my buddy not go with me? He knows that I am not the cheapest option for his requirements and just uses me for his bigger budget jobs. FYI, I am not crazy high price. There are services that professional photographer will offer that are an excellent fit for small businesses.\\n5) Professional Editing – In the consumer market, it’s not unusual for a brand-new photographer to shoot a session and burn a huge number of images to a disc and they are done. A real professional cares more about their work and credibility than to just turn over a disc of the images. Real professional photographers edit their work even if it’s just a fast run through of Adobe Lightroom. However, some images need large amounts of attention which could take a number of minutes to an hour plus just to appropriately modify one image. Ask if the photographer you are considering edits their work. This is one easy way for the photographer to save you some money and them time but likely provide good results vs. great.\\n6) Because He or She Is Professional – A true professional photographer will act in professional manner in the way they do business. There is something to be said in any business about professionalism. A plumber may not be looked at like an attorney, but the plumber should still treat you with respect, as well as respecting your residence by not walking on your carpet in muddy shoes and provide services in a manner that leaves you feeling 100% satisfied! A professional photographer, especially in the world of business, ought to not only provide great photography services but make you feel happy by his/her mindset.\\nOur lives on this earth are short-lived, but photographs are timeless! Leave a piece of you with those you love in still images. Give them something to remember you by, to keep, to value. I hope that after reading this you will think about hiring a professional photographer for all your photography needs. carry out some research! Find a photographer who’s style you like, and take some time to connect with them. Finding and selecting the correct photographer will leave you with incredible memories and beautiful photographs to enjoy for a life time.\\nLynn Haven is a city in Bay County, Florida, United States, north of Panama City.

Favorable Winds , Warden of Evos Isle and Esper Stormblade would all be useful additions to that end.\\nThe decklist looks cool, some suggestions. If you are going to run Delver of Secrets Flip you are gonna need a lot more spells and scrying so that it can be flipped more consistantly (Also run 4 of Delver, and 4 Pteramander. Cut out Mistcloaked Herald). That also works well with Pteramander so you can adapt it a bit easier. The one thing that you REALLY should run is Remand , it is a great tempo play, and you also draw another card. Spell Pierce is great. Serum Visions for the scrying. A great budget option for blue is Nimble Obstructionist , since it is a flying threat with flash AND can counter any activated or triggerd ability you do not control. Depending on your budget you really cannot go wrong with Snapcaster Mage , since you can reuse any spell. Vendilion Clique is great for tempo, another threat in the air and lets you take an important card from your opponents hand it is great against combo decks. I would take out Favorable Winds since it is a bit slow and Pteramander , Tempest Djinn and Delver of Secrets Flip are great finishers, seems a bit redundant. Not so sure about the Unstable Mutation but i do se the appeal of it.

Working after retirement from need and/or desire has made retiree employment a game changer, benefiting employers with talented and mature help as well as retirees with more exciting jobs. Retirees are sought after by an increasing number of companies, and many retirees are finding life-affirming work to help them live life as they want to live it in retirement.\\nWhen companies need someone skilled but without a strict schedule requirement for short-term projects, retirees save the day. Oftentimes, they already know the job well enough to require little to no training, and their flexible schedule makes a big difference. Companies sometimes retain the contact information of their employees when they retire so they can invite them to return as needed for reliable work. If there’s not enough of past employees to fit their need, they’ll also seek out new retirees skilled in the industry for the same purpose.\\nMany companies are also embracing seniors and retirees for more regular part-time work because they’ve seen that there is a wealth of untapped talent here.\\nSome companies, such as PKF O’Connor Davies, are deliberately campaigning for new senior and retiree talent.\\nRetirement is an ideal time to pursue a job that suits your interests: hostess at a restaurant, for instance; work with kids in a daycare; or get a job as a receptionist.\\nCoolWorks: check it out for yourself!

My consultation which was around a week ago, was so informative. Dr Gharib made me feel so comfortable about the whole procedure which is why I went ahead with his recommendation of skin peeling and mesotherapy. At the consultation he asked me what my concerns were regarding my skin to which I explained how due to having to wear make up so often because of my career, my skin sometimes breaks out with mild acne. I also told him how I’m unhappy with the hollowness and darkness around my eye area. Even after having just one consultation, it was so invaluable. Dr Gharib made me understand what’s going on with my skin and why. It all makes so much sense now, meaning I can do as much as I can within my control to help my skin improve. I don’t want to bombard you with too much text so please follow my YouTube channel www.youtube.com/ninaubhi where I will be uploading the final journey of my experience of Skin Peeling and Mesotheraphy once I’ve completed all four sessions. I’ll also be posting on my blog after each session so I can really give you my full experience.\\nSESSION ONE I’ve been sick for the last few days and thankfully I felt well enough to go out yesterday afternoon. So luckily I made it for my first session of skin peeling and mesotherapy at the Kaya Skin Clinic. Firstly, the staff at Kaya Skin Clinic are so professional and they made the whole process so much easier and secondly they have a branch in Marina which is so close to me! Skin Peel: So I arrived with zero make up on and settled down in the treatment room. The nurse started by firstly explaining the process and then cleansing my face to remove any residue. Then comes the high frequency Accura machine that is glided across my skin manually by the nurse, continuously for around 10 minutes; this calms any inflammation and reduces the size of spots. She then started the skin detox by extracting any open comedones. Once the skin is cleansed, Dr Gharib applies the skin peel treatment over my face and it’s left on for a few minutes. There’s a slight tingling sensation but nothing too uncomfortable. The skin peel treatment is removed by spraying cold water onto the face and pressing it off with a thick towel/gauze followed by some ice over the skin to cool it down. After this my skin felt totally normal and after an hour or so a little tight. I’ve been told my skin may feel dry and tight which it has but it’s not peeling like you assume it would be by the sound of the name. Mesotherapy: The nurse applied numbing cream to my under eyes and eyelids. After leaving it on for 20 minutes Dr Gharib then removed the cream and started injecting vitamins into the skin around the eyes. It didn’t hurt at all, thankfully due to the numbing cream.\\nIf you’re looking for a relaxing and soothing facial type experience then this isn’t it. But it’s also not uncomfortable. It’s a treatment to help clear up your skin and I love the fact I already feel it working. It’s only been a day and I’m looking forward to my next session. Each session of the skin peel needs to be 15 days apart and the mesotherapy needs to be every week.\\nTo book a consultation with Dr Gharib contact Kaya Skin Clinic on +971 4 4508438.\\nMesotherapy is getting great results, it hurts a little in you don’t use a proper anesthetic but no one can argue with the results.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-25T00:55:04Z', 'url': 'https://ninaubhi.com/skin-peel-mesotherapy-session-1-kaya-skin-clinic/'}\n","{'text': 'Just having a bit of good clean fun here at PHA!\\nMore fun from the Spanish Fashion Show at PHA!\\nIt\\'s springtime in the garden at PHA!\\nIn honor of Earth Day PHA is adopting two animals!

Mariah Carey was topping the charts. George W. Bush was starting his second term as U.S. president. Hamid Karzai was the new leader of the “liberated” Afghanistan.\\nAnd the Blazer? Well, the SUV built on the frame of a S-10 pickup was ready to retire.\\nNow, after a 14-year break, Chevrolet has brought back a mid-sized crossover SUV under the name Blazer. But, other than the name, you’d be hard pressed to connect the new SUV with the rough-and-ready truck from yesteryear.\\nBlazer is five-passenger, two-row crossover that fits between the compact Equinox and three-row Traverse.\\nIt is attractive – much better looking – than the original, and displays far superior road manners. Its smooth and quiet ride is a credit to unibody construction, instead of the old body-on-frame. It’s also more fuel-efficient, thanks to stop/start technology, cylinder deactivation in the V6 and a smooth-shifting nine-speed automatic that always seems to know the right gear.\\nIts frisky RS trim level is the hot rod of the family. It has the boldest look, with a blacked-out front end and black up-sized 21-inch wheels (from standard 18-inch). It looks especially good on a bright red body colour. Its engine growl is just loud enough to let you know the optional 3.6-litre V6 means business, cranking out a respectable 305 hp and 269 lb.-ft. of torque.\\nThe Premier trim level is more dignified, with generous chrome treatment on the outside and quality accented leather interior treatment. Automatic heated steering wheel and heated/ventilated front seats tie in with the automatic climate control system. The windows can be opened remotely to let cabin heat out as you approach the car.\\nAll models have HID headlamps mounted low and LED daytime running lights.\\nCargo space is an impressive 1,818 litres with the rear seated folded. A rail-based system allows the space to be configured and blocked off as needed to secure items, and the rails store neatly in front of the spare tire when not needed.\\nThere are some nifty touches to this vehicle – like a hands-free power liftgate with a light that shines a Chevy emblem on the ground to show you where to swing your foot. Inside, the rear seat slides forward to allow more cargo space and tilts back to allow extra headroom – unnecessary, since a six-footer can easily fit with the seat upright.\\nChevrolet’s updated Infotainment 3 system comes with 8.0-inch touchscreen, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. There are up to six USB ports – even the new USB type-C standard – wireless phone charging, and a subscription-based 4G LTE WiFi hot spot. Active noise cancelling is standard on all trim levels. The rearview camera “hitch view” makes hooking up to a trailer a one-person job.\\nChevy started with the platform found on the XT5 and Acadia models, but it moved the wheels 44 millimetres further out to gain a squatter, planted feel, said Larry Mihalko, Chevy’s vehicle performance manager.\\nThe sporty RS also has high rate suspension springs, heavy stabilizer bars, sport-turned dampers and oversized shock absorbers. Although a relatively tall vehicle, the clever engineers have made this SUV feel very sportscar-like.\\nIts frisky RS trim level is the hot rod of the family. It has the boldest look, with a blacked-out front end and black up-sized 21-inch wheels (from standard 18-inch).\\nThe active yaw control system inputs traction data 100 times per second and adjusts power to each wheel. In hard cornering, it sends up to 80 per cent of the power to the outside rear wheel to push the SUV in the right direction.\\nDrivers can also switch to front-wheel drive to cut fuel consumption under highway conditions. Fuel economy ranges around 9 litres/100 km in combined city/highway driving. The stock 2.5-litre turbo-charged four-cylinder offers a marginal gain in fuel economy over the six, and delivers 193 hp and 188 lb.-ft. of torque.\\nA trip to the hills east of San Diego, Calif., confirms that this is an able highway cruiser, but no off-road bruiser. It comes equipped with street tires and a low front end that would whither at the first sight of a rock.\\nEven so, there’s much to like in this revived Blazer. The entry-level basic model starts at just over C$30,000 in Canada, is well-equipped and offers good value. The highest trim levels, however, are more than C$50,000 – definitely pushing the limits of the category, which includes Mazda CX5, Ford Edge, Nissan Murano, and Toyota Highlander.\\nYou don’t have to go high-end to get a fun ride with the Blazer. Whatever configuration you choose, it feels like a sturdy and stable vehicle designed for city and highway driving.\\nThe Blazer is available for order across North America now.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-23T09:55:50Z', 'url': 'https://tractionlife.com/2019-chevrolet-blazer-first-drive-review/'}\n","{'text': 'Taras Filatov graduated from Kharkiv National University of Radioelectronics (KNURE), Ukraine and passed his Master of Philosophy at the Wessex Institute of Technology (WIT). Taras continued his research at WIT and has now successfully passed his PhD viva with the thesis ‘Adaptive Evolutionary Navigation in Knowledge Representation Systems’. His external examiner was Dr Gary Wills from the University of Southampton and the internal was Dr Andrés Peratta.\\nThe main objective of this work was to develop architecture and carry out the implementation of a fully automated knowledge representation system, capable of rendering textual documents from various unstructured sources, online or offline, into a single web knowledge base where navigation was automatically provided by the system. This navigation was carried out using the principles of natural browsing.\\nThe system architecture was developed in two main parts: data preparation and interactive knowledge representation. Novel approaches were introduced in both the data compression and representation parts to overcome difficulties that had prevented the construction of comprehensive full cycle systems in the past.\\nThe data preparation employed modern information retrieval techniques, such as search engine elements, and represented the documents corpus as vector space. However, a distinguishing part was the application of the dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the vector space while keeping the relevance calculation features by reducing the dimensionality on initial vector space to intrinsic dimensionality value.\\nThe interactive knowledge representation implemented the innovative concept of a ‘live’ navigational panel powered with evolutionary algorithms. This was achieved through the system of rules divided into two algorithms serving both dormant and active cycles of user-system interaction.\\nAs a result of his research, both examiners recommended the award of Doctor of Philosophy.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-18T19:12:44Z', 'url': 'https://www.wessex.ac.uk/news/graduation-ceremonies/757-taras-filatov-phd'}\n","{'text': \"The 1 Series offers all that BMW stands for in a compact package.

The new law indicates that vehicles with a Gross Mass over 3,500kg must be fitted with a tachograph that will record the driver and vehicle’s activities. Gross Mass is calculated as the weight of the vehicle as well as the trailer towed behind it. In order to be in compliance, drivers not only need to have the tachograph, but also obey hours regulations. Unfortunately, not all of the smaller vehicles that now fall under the requirement are able to be fitted with the devices. Both van manufacturers and tachometer manufacturers need to find solutions.\\nThis law was not an issue previously, as until recently vehicles Gross Mass was lower than 3,490kg.

I\\'m speaking to you from the now, in the middle of the now.\") Crane also croons with his fellow Golf Boys bandmates Rickie Fowler, Hunter Mahan and Bubba Watson (with lyrics by Mat Kearney, the singer-songwriter who, like Crane, hails from Oregon). But the 37-year-old funnyman also has an intense side. You\\'ve heard of the 10,000 hours it takes to master a pursuit? Crane has logged 35,000 hours honing his game. (He counted.) If you think that\\'s odd, consider that Crane believes he\\'s no more innately talented at golf than you are. The main reason he chose this career path was because as a kid he could beat his five buddies. The Tour\\'s biggest ham talks about the 100 percent commitment required to excel at both golf and comedy, his infamously slow pace of play, and why he won\\'t let the bad back that knocked him out of the 2013 FedEx Cup playoffs diminish his enthusiasm -- or his sense of humor.\\nIn the media center after you won the 2010 Farmers Insurance Open, you broke into an impersonation of your southern-fried, former-college-football-coach agent Tommy Limbaugh. It got quite a laugh, even among the cynical press. Was that when you realized you could bring your act to a wider audience?\\nIt\\'s been a slow progression, no pun intended, where things have just worked. The more you show your personality, the more fun everyone else has. I\\'m watching tennis last night, I\\'m watching Rafael Nadal play a guy, and it was 6-0 in the first set, and in the second set the guy is just trying to score a point. He finally thought he scored one; they did the shot-spot thing, and it was out by an inch. It was the moment where he should have gone, like, What do I gotta do to score a point against this Nadal guy? But he didn\\'t. Athletes get so stuck in competition sometimes that we just can\\'t let go of it.\\nHas your game improved since you\\'ve been expressing this lighter side?\\nWell, 2010 and 2005 were my best years, but it\\'s been a battle with my body. I have a lot more potential now, and I have a bigger team around me. Instead of no one following me, now I\\'ll have friends who are following me, and sometimes they\\'ll walk up to a random person and say, \"Who are you following?\" In a few cases the person has said, \"Ben Crane. He\\'s my favorite player.\" And my friend will go, \"Why?\" And the kid will say, \"You don\\'t know? You don\\'t know about the videos?\" [Laughs] That is so fun right there.\\nYour fans definitely get your sense of humor. When your caddie decided to take a day off on a Wednesday, and you told people to apply on Twitter for the one-day job to replace him, you got interesting responses, like, \"I have a rough tongue like a cat and can clean the grooves of a wedge in seconds. My tics are mostly silent.\"\\n[Laughs] That deserves to be written somewhere in this magazine! That is so good. We\\'ve opened up the job twice, actually. We did it at the Byron Nelson and at the Travelers. For the Nelson, we found a guy who had played in college. It was his birthday. And for the Travelers, we did it for a cause called Charity: Water, and the guy bid a couple of thousand bucks. He was awesome. We really hit it off.\\nDo you think most Tour pros could stand to loosen up?\\nI don\\'t think, I know. I mean, I\\'m very serious between the ropes at times, especially when it\\'s not going well. I can feel like I can\\'t let myself have a good time. But guys need to pick their chin up a little bit and look around. Dude, you\\'re on the PGA Tour! You\\'ve probably dreamed about this since you were a kid. It\\'s so fun. I don\\'t care if you just made double; you have the opportunity to look at a kid and throw him a ball and make his day. I try to remember that.\\nYou show full comedic commitment in your spoof videos, which you have to do to make them work. Your wardrobe gets laughs, too. Where did the helmet come from? In the video where you offer exercise tips, it\\'s a crucial prop, along with the unitard.\\nMy buddy went to Goodwill and found it. I was like, \"What is this thing?\" It\\'s a low-end ski helmet. I never picked up on that until the fifth video. That whole outfit is like five bucks at Good-will. It\\'s awful. It\\'s so tight. It doesn\\'t breathe. It would be great in the Oregon fall, for surfing.\\nWho are your favorite comedians? Have you seen Borat?\\nI have not seen Borat. Honestly, the stuff that Joel [Stock], my caddie, and I have seen -- he has a great sense of humor and a great memory for funny lines -- would be \"Coming to America,\" \"Spies Like Us,\" \"Caddyshack\" and \"Dumb and Dumber.\"\\nRight. Kind of like \"Life of Pi.\" At the end you go, \"Ah, now it makes sense.\"\\nUnfortunately, \"Planes.\" It was a big letdown. \"Shrek\" was amazing. \"Cars\" was amazing. \"Planes\" was not. And \"Finding Nemo\" was great.\\nYou have three kids, so it\\'s obvious who\\'s picking the movies. What TV shows do you watch?\\nYou know, I\\'m trying to think if I\\'ve turned on the TV this year for something other than sports. I watched the Bible documentary. When you have three kids under 6, you have to ask, am I going to space out on the couch for an hour and a half, or am I going to hang out with my kids? When your kids are grown up and out of the house, everyone says, \"It happened so fast. I wish they were back.\"\\nMusician Mat Kearney helped with the lyrics on Golf Boys 2.0 and the Bubble Boy video, which poked fun at you for being 125th on the money list at the Barclays. Which video took the longest to make?\\nGolf Boys 2.0 was six weeks of talking to the production crew and doing some of the writing with Kearney, and giving feedback and stuff. The shoot only took two days, but afterward, editing and stuff, it was a couple of months. We shot it at Vaquero here in Dallas.\\nDid everyone stay at your house?\\nThey did, except for Hunter, who lives here. Bubba bought my daughter her first Elmo. He\\'s awesome with kids. And Rickie was on the floor rolling around with them. It was funny; we were driving to the course and one of Kearney\\'s songs came on the radio. I was sitting there thinking, What do you do when you\\'re sitting right next to a guy whose song is on the radio? Do you sing along?\\nDo you ever play money games with Ryan Palmer or Todd Hamilton or any of the other pros who live and play at Vaquero?\\nI should, but it\\'s really just practice. I like playing in the Phil money game, the Mickelson game on Tuesdays. It\\'s competitive. I\\'ve played in that a few times, and you\\'re so ready to play in the tournament after that.\\nMickelson loves to get in guys\\' ears. Give us your best Phil smack-talking story.\\nA few months back, Phil and I were playing a match in an off-week, and we were on the 10th green, both about eight feet away for birdie. He said, \"I found the secret to putting.\" And I said, \"Really?\" Well, I make my putt and he misses, and because he\\'s always jabbing me, I say, \"Looks like I had the secret to putting on that one.\" He thinks about it for about 10 seconds and says, \"Yeah, but I had the secret to putting at the British Open.\" [Laughs] Yes, he did.\\nYou rapped with Bubba Watson on the 16th tee during the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Were you more nervous for that or the golf?\\nI was going to do it anyway. I had the helmet in the bag and everything. And then Bubba and I got paired together. I mean, are you kidding me? It was perfect. And there\\'s a guy who stands up there and says, \"Hey, crowd, be quiet,\" and so we went over and grabbed his microphone. But, yeah, I was nervous.\\nRory Sabbatini famously left you in the dust at the 2005 Booz Allen at Congressional. Have you gotten much faster with your pace of play since then?\\nRory and I are friends, and I\\'ve tried to get better. Last year I talked to Jon Brendle, a Tour official, and they see everything. I said, \"Hey, how am I doing?\" His reaction was very positive. He said, \"Just keep up with the group in front of you.\" I don\\'t want guys to get bummed out when they get paired with me. I didn\\'t even know in high school and college golf that I was slow. No one ever said anything.\\nYou beat Rory Mcllroy 8 and 7 in the WGC-Accenture Match Play in 2011, and later that year you made eight birdies in the last 11 holes to force a playoff with Webb Simpson in the McGladrey Classic, which you then won. Were you hotter when you thumped Rory or when you beat Webb?\\nWhen I made those eight birdies, I got so hot with the putter. Webb told me he went back and watched the broadcast, like, six months later. He said, \"I got so mad. They were going in from across the green!\" With Rory, I was playing some of the best golf of my life, but my back went out the next morning on the range.\\nYou finished the year 139th in driving distance. Was that because of your back?\\nMy clubhead speed on the Nation-wide Tour was about 124 miles an hour. If I saw the front lip of a bunker 300 yards out, I wouldn\\'t even think about it -- I\\'d just fly it. I was so long. I was No. 1 in driving distance for the first five months of the season out there, but then I got injured and stopped working on being fast, and now I\\'m way down in driving distance. [Laughs] I can\\'t smoke it anymore.\\nDid that inspire you to become a better short-game player?\\nIt contributed to it. Plus, when you\\'re not feeling well you can at least work on your chipping and putting, which I did. I would swing on a launch monitor and think about how I could get faster. I went from 115 mph to 124 mph in about a year.\\nYou\\'ve worked with short-game coach James Sieckmann for a few years. How much of your short-game prowess do you owe to him? Why do you two click?\\nI was having some trouble with my chipping and pitching, with my contact, especially on Bermuda grass with tight lies. I was like, \"I\\'m missing something.\" I spoke to Tom Pernice, who said, \"You should go see my guy.\" I said, \"You\\'ve got a guy?\" It\\'s been dynamite. I think I\\'m top 10 in bunker play. He really understands the mental game, too.\\nHave you also seen improvement in your wedge play?\\nI\\'m much more confident with that 50-yard shot, the 60-yard shot, just because he\\'s taught me proper technique and how to practice for that shot. The difference between the best player in the world and the guy who finishes 100th on the money list is not much -- maybe one shot a round.\\nIt\\'s a fine line out there. \"It\\'s a fine line between clever and stupid.\" Do you know what that\\'s from?\\n\"This Is Spinal Tap.\" Have you seen that film?\\nYou have to see \"Spinal Tap\"! For a comedy lover, it\\'s an absolute must.\\nOkay, it\\'s on my list. I\\'ll write it down.\\nYou used to not look at the Tour pairings to see who you were playing with the next day, in case it was someone you grew up idolizing. Do you still not look?\\nI still don\\'t look. The Tour sends you your tee time for the next day, but it goes to my caddie\\'s phone, it goes to my wife\\'s phone, but not to my phone. Some guys will spoil the surprise and say, \"Looks like it\\'s you and me tomorrow.\"\\nYou learned the game at the age of 5 from your grandfather, right?\\nYeah, my grandpa was like my best friend, and if I wanted to hang out with him we were going to play golf. The cool thing was, he had three old guys he played with, and one of his cronies died when I was 8 or 10, so I took his spot. We gambled a lot. We played a dime a hole, and double or nothing on 18, so it was big money. That was when I learned to love the game. That was at Portland Golf Club, which we live a block away from in the summer.\\nAre you a member there?\\nYeah, they gave me an honorary membership. They have a plaque saying that that\\'s where I learned to play. There\\'s a lot of history there. They had a Ryder Cup in . Hogan played there, and a lot of the greats, so they\\'re like, \"Do you want us to put your plaque up?\" [Laughs] I\\'m like, \"No, no, in the ground is fine.\" So they put it in the ground next to the putting green.\\nYou\\'re a big tennis fan. What else did you play as a kid?\\nI\\'d seen my dad going to work every day [he owned a small media-development firm] and I thought, That looks terrible. I\\'ve got to figure out professional sports. I played basketball until 10th grade, but I was vertically challenged and maybe the fourth-best player on my team. Soccer, I was the third-best guy on my team. Baseball, I\\'m kind of afraid of the ball. Golf, well, I was the best golfer of my five friends, so I decided to go for it. I quit everything else, practiced every day as hard as I could. The pro I worked with growing up used to say, \"I think if I worked a little harder I could\\'ve made it.\" I thought, I\\'ll never say that.\\nSo you got your 10,000 hours in.\\nThirty-five thousand -- I added \\'em up.\\nSo you should be really good by now, given you\\'ve put in more than three times as much as the 10,000 hours that Malcolm Gladwell recommends in his book \"Outliers.\"\\nI read \"Bounce\" [by Matthew Syed] and \"Talent is Overrated\" [by Geoff Colvin]. I think Bounce is the best one. He proved that guys like Mozart, Roger Federer -- it has nothing to do with genes; it\\'s about putting in specific, intense hours of practice. Of course, you can\\'t play post for the Houston Rockets if you\\'re my size.\\nSo you don\\'t think you have any more innate ability at golf than a bogey golfer?\\nNo. I think we all have unique gifts, but just about anyone can train to be just about anything.\\nWell, that\\'s both encouraging and discouraging. Four victories on Tour, two Web.com wins -- are you done? You\\'re 37, and you\\'ve got a bad back. Is this it?\\nNo. I\\'m planning to do the Steve Stricker thing. I\\'m planning to go to 47, and I\\'m planning to have the best decade of my career from 37 to 47. I am so confident that my best golf is in front of me -- and this is the shooter\\'s mentality in basketball -- that I\\'m thinking of putting money down on myself in Vegas.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-25T14:57:55Z', 'url': 'https://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/pga-tours-ben-crane-why-pros-need-lighten-and-why-his-best-golf-may-be-ahead-him'}\n","{'text': 'Vodafone 4G plans ,Offers and packs for Vodafone includes 4G Internet Data packs,offers and special recharges to browse 4G High speed Internet.

But the real kicker for me is that while they are KITS, they are still wonderfully open-ended. There is no right or wrong way to create bubble wands or garden art or any other art or craft in the Artterro kits (and we’ve tried just about all of their art kits at this point).\\nWe were excited to try out Artterro’s bubble wand kit, partly because who doesn’t love a bubble wand?\\nAnd an even more sustainable focus.\\nAmong other changes, the packaging is now made from 100% recycled cardboard.\\nMaia, Daphne, and I got to work on making bubble wands with the kit.\\nEach kit has two painted wooden dowels so can officially be used to make 2 bubble wands. However, if you have a few sticks or dowels around, you could easily make several more with the amount of wire and glass beads included.\\nMaia and I poked wire through the holes at the tops of the wooden dowels, bent it into our desired bubble wand shapes, then looped it back down and wrapped it around the dowels to secure it.\\nMaia made a simple heart-shaped bubble wand (above).\\nDaphne and I collaborated to make a flower-shaped bubble wand.\\nThe bubble wand kit says it’s for ages 8 and up, but Daphne, at 4, was able to participate at her own level.\\nI did the wire bending and cutting on our wand and she did the bead stringing (one of her favorite activities).\\nHere’s our finished flower bubble wand.\\nThe kit doubles as a garden art kit, with thicker wire and bigger beads and marbles for the garden art.\\nBut then decided they were too awesome as silly dress up glasses.\\nSo she created a spiral for the garden instead. The beads are meant to be attached by wrapping the thinner wire around them, but Maia had a bit of trouble with that, and decided to use scotch tape instead.\\nHave you made homemade bubble wands? Or garden art?\\nP.S. Tomorrow I’ll share photos from our afternoon of bubble blowing with our new homemade bubble wands!\\nIf you’d like to try out this or other art kits, check out the new and improved arts and crafts kits in the Artterro shop or read on for an Artterro art kit giveaway.\\nTo enter the giveaway for a chance to win both Artterro’s Deluxe Bubble Wand Kit as well as their Needle Felting Kit, leave a comment to this post by Friday, April 25th at 11:59 pm EST.

But when your chimney’s flue isn’t topped with a chimney cap, animals of various kinds will take that as an open invitation to move into your chimney and into your home. And since your chimney isn’t the only vent open to the outdoors, it’s not your only animal concern — your dryer vent can allow animals to make their way in as well.\\nThe most efficient way to prevent animal intruders is to have a chimney cap or animal guard installed by Blue Sky Chimney Sweeps.\\nBirds, squirrels, raccoons, bats and even snakes have been known to enter homes through a chimney that doesn’t have a chimney cap or an animal guard protecting it. It makes sense: Your chimney is a tall structure that can offer protection to nesting animals. Unfortunately, although adult birds and animals can often leave your chimney as easily as they came into it, their babies aren’t as capable. If they can’t exit by climbing up, their natural reaction is to try and get down, which brings them into your home, causing considerable damage along the way as they frantically try to escape. If they don’t make it out of your chimney at all, they’ll likely die, causing an array of other problems, including odors and maggot infestations.\\nWild animals that come into your home bring annoying noises and unwanted smells, but they routinely bring along bigger concerns, too.

His hand remains evident in CPT’s training and deployment of long-term, diverse, disciplined and empowered teams; in team and office meals and shared check-ins; in CPT’s creative direct action to reduce violence and highlight injustice; in patterns of prayer and mutual support sending each other out truly blessed; in CPT’s attentiveness to exposing privilege and undoing oppression; and in CPT’s deep roots of connection throughout the Church, which is in turn transformed into a hotbed of peacemaking.\\nGene brought tremendous energy, courage and commitment to the work of Christian peacemaking. During his tenure as director, CPT grew from a dream and a dialog about active peacemaking, to sustaining and supporting full-time field teams with hundreds of trained CPTers working in partnership with local peacemakers in conflict zones across the globe.\\nGene saw a military culture worldwide and asked how the church could create a counter-culture.

Rev. B 81, 165104 (2010)] fermionic Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS) were used to approximate the ground state of free and interacting spinless fermion models, as well as the $t$-$J$ model. This paper revisits these three models in the presence of an additional next-nearest hopping amplitude in the Hamiltonian. First we explain how to account for next-nearest neighbor Hamiltonian terms in the context of fermionic PEPS algorithms based on simulating time evolution. Then we present benchmark calculations for the three models of fermions, and compare our results against analytical, mean-field, and variational Monte Carlo results, respectively. Consistent with previous computations restricted to nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians, we systematically obtain more accurate (or better converged) results for gapped phases than for gapless ones.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-24T13:15:11Z', 'url': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3937'}\n","{'text': 'What is it, what does it do? – A VPN is often described a secure tunnel for your online traffic.

It is a trick movement that was first described by Dail (1951) when patients with poliomyelitis were observed to be gulping air into their lungs. It was this gulping action that gave the technique the name \\'frog breathing\\'.\\nGlossopharyngeal breathing is a form of positive pressure ventilation produced by the patient\\'s voluntary muscles where boluses of air are forced into the lungs. Paralyzed patients dependent on a mechanical ventilator may be able to use GPB continuously, other than during sleep, to substitute the mechanical ventilation. The most common use of GPB is in patients who are able to breathe spontaneously but whose power to cough and clear secretions is inadequate. The technique may enable these patients to shout to attract attention and it may help to maintain or improve lung and chest wall compliance (Dail et al 1955).\\nTo breathe in, a series of pumping strokes is produced by action of the lips, tongue, soft palate, pharynx and larynx. Air is held in the chest by the larynx which acts as a valve as the mouth is opened for the next gulp. Before starting to teach a patient glossopharyngeal breathing it is helpful for him to inflate his chest using an intermittent positive pressure ventilator with a mouthpiece. He can practice holding the breath while removing the mouthpiece and avoiding escape of air through the larynx or nose. The most important step in learning GPB is the up and down movement of the cricoid cartilage while keeping the jaw still. The patient can practice by watching the movement in a mirror and feeling the cartilage with his fingers.\\nThis sequence should be practised slowly at first and then gradually speeded up until the movement flows. A leak of air may occur through the nose and, until it is prevented by the soft palate, a nose dip may be required.\\nThe next stage is to take a maximum breath in and, while holding this breath, to add several glossopharyngeal gulps, to augment the vital capacity. When correct, the patient will feel his chest filling with air, and the physiotherapist can test the \\'GPB vital capacity\\' by putting a mouthpiece attached to the expiratory limb of a Wright\\'s respirometer in the patient\\'s mouth before he exhales.\\nThe respirometer can be used to measure the volume per gulp; the patient will require less effort and reach his maximum capacity more quickly if he develops a bigger volume per gulp. A study by Kelleher & Parida (1957) reported a group of patients in whom the average volume per gulp varied from 25-120 ml, and when teaching GPB an attempt should be made to achieve at least 60 ml per gulp. When used for clearance of secretions, 10-20 gulps may be required to obtain a maximal vital capacity, but if GPB is being used continuously as a substitute for normal tidal breathing approximately 6-8 gulps may be taken before breathing out.\\nGlossopharyngeal breathing would normally be taught with the patient in a comfortable sitting position, but when mastered should be practiced in positions useful for the patient to clear his bronchial secretions. After filling his chest to capacity he signals to the physiotherapist who compresses his chest as he lets the air out The patient may have sufficient muscle power to apply compression himself or carers can be taught to give assistance.\\nGPB is learnt easily by some patients, but others need time and patience to acquire this skill and must be motivated to practise frequently during the learning period. It is a valuable technique to consider when treating tetraplegic or poliomyelitis patients with a vital capacity of less man 2 litres. Instruction can begin when the patient has reached a stable condition, but it is inappropriate in the acute phase or during an acute chest infection. When successfully learnt it is invaluable during a period of chest infection to assist in the clearance of secretions. For a patient with a chest infection nursed in a \\'tank\\' ventilator (\\'iron lung\\'), assisted coughing (Higgens 1966) may be more effective if the patient uses GPB to augment the inspiratory volume received from the ventilator before chest compression is applied.\\nIt is possible to teach Glossopharyngeal breathing to patients with an uncuffed tracheostomy tube, provided there is an effective seal round the tube to avoid air leaks.\\nGlossopharyngeal breathing should not be attempted in patients with neuromuscular disorders affecting swallowing, and, in patients with a progressive disorder, intermittent positive pressure breathing ( I P P B ) may be more appropriate than GPB. The technique is contraindicated in patients with airflow obstruction or pulmonary disease.\\nFrançois Maltais \"Glossopharyngeal-Breathing\", American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Vol. 184, No. 3 (2011), pp. 381.\\nAssociation of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care.

I quickly cut out an avocado out of Dollar Tree cardboard paper and it was a success! Smiley won some toys and we got a growler for our fun last-minute costume.\\nYou may have noticed the dog pictures on my Instagram, or read the two posts I wrote about our rescue Smiley – you may have even read the viral Dodo article about his rescue story! Our unexpected adoption (it only took two weeks of fostering to realize that Smiley belonged with us forever) changed all our plans. All those crazy Halloween parties we wanted to go to turned into us going to dog-friendly pub events, the dog parade and tonight we’ll be going to the big NYC Halloween Parade with Smiley in tow.\\nWe ended up going to another last minute event, the Tompkins Square dog parade, so Smiley wore his same avocadog costume and got outshined by popes and other crazy intricate creative costumes! It was a lot of fun and we’re definitely going again next year with a better costume. Although most dogs wore hot dogs, delivery costumes and they rocked them, as a crafter I got inspired to do something a little more creative!\\nTonight, the parade is mainly for people but Smiley will hopefully steal the show – as long as he actually wears the costume I made him and it doesn’t fall apart. Stay tuned for photos of tonights shenanigans.\\nAuthor olenakaguiPosted on October 31, 2018 Categories Animals and Pets, New YorkTags Avocadog, Halloween, Halloween parade, Halloween party, New York, Smiley, TompkinsLeave a comment on Happy Halloween: Smiley’s Dog Costumes!\\nTwo days ago we sent a $300 adoption fee to Pound Hounds Res-Q, the place that pulled Smiley from Brooklyn’s high kill shelter, NYACC. We had originally planned on fostering Smiley, the cute 6 year old pit mix who was abandoned because his former owners got pregnant. We were in no position to get a dog – we don’t make enough money and live in a small apartment, but we couldn’t let Smiley die.\\nWe ended up adopting Smiley after just two weeks of fostering, mostly because we fell in love with our foster boy and also because of Pound Hounds Res-Q. In addition to the fee, we also gave a small donation because of everything the rescue has done for us. Donating to rescues helps them save more dogs so I encourage everyone to do the same!\\nThe amazing thing about fostering, is that it’s practically free and saves lives! Shelters such as the NYACC become overcrowded and put animals on the kill list very quickly. They barely get a chance to get adopted! If you foster a dog, a rescue will cover the vet bills and any necessary training. Then you help the dog get decompressed, preferably crate trained and then you help them find a new forever home.\\nFostering is a great way to help animals without making a lifetime commitment, that many people can’t do. If we hadn’t ended up adopting Smiley, we would have likely kept fostering, because it has been so rewarding. Let me tell you a bit about it!\\nSmiley went from the NYACC to the vet to get neutered, then a special service was hired to bring him to us. We had never met him or even see him in real life! Smiley was friendly and curious but he wouldn’t look up at me or make eye contact. He also didn’t respond to commands, although we were told that he knew to sit, stay and come.\\nWhen I brought him inside, he explored the place, sniffing every corner and demanding to know what was behind every door. It took over an hour to get him to slow down and rest on his doggy bed. He lay there for a while until I tried to put his harness on for a walk. He wouldn’t let me put it on I’m and bared his teeth, so I backed off and let him sleep. A few hours later, after my husband came home, he let us put the harness on without any fuss.\\nOn his first walk with us, he pulled like crazy, giving us rope burn. He was so strong and wouldn’t listen at all outside. We immediately ordered a front pulling harness, but got dragged around painfully for three whole days. We also watched some videos on how to get a dogs attention on walks and we tried to implement them, which only half worked.\\nThe first evening while we watched TV, we saw him watching us from his bed. It was the first time he looked at us. Not surprising after being handed off from one person to another for ten days. He was scared and confused.\\nWe crated him that first night as instructed by the rescue. People want to adopt crate trained dogs and we had to try our best although we didn’t like the idea of him being in a small cage. He barked a bit but quickly went to sleep. The next morning he woke up wagging his tail at us, it was progress!\\nThe second day he acted like a spoiled child, pushing his boundaries. He would jump on the sofa, demand treats and he pulled me even harder outside. I may have had one or two breakdowns that day because I couldn’t connect with him. I couldn’t see anyone adopting a dog that was this crazy and I also didn’t know how long I could spend with him, but I didn’t want to disappoint him like humans have in the past.\\nThat night he barked more in his crate at night, and I was stressed knowing that we would have to leave him alone for up to six hours the next day. Everyone reassured me that he would be okay, as long as he wore a cone – he was recently neutered and could rip his stitches.\\nWhen we came home after our trip, that we couldn’t cancel although we had wanted to, we found his cone out of shape and he was practically hanging by it because a piece got stuck in his crate. It was around his neck so tight that he coughed when I cut it off. He seemed fine otherwise and extra friendly, but I was traumatized by the experience. I was too scared of putting him back in the crate while he had his cone, so we let him sleep in our bedroom on his bed.\\nWhen he woke up that Sunday (we had gotten him in the afternoon on Thursday) he was a completely different dog. He was so calm at home, looked at us, asked us for pats and actually listened when we gave him commands. That day we took him to a beer festival because we didn’t want to leave him home alone.\\nWe had been told that he shouldn’t be around other dogs or kids so we were extra careful. But he was calm around kids, accepting treats gently and he wagged his tail when he saw other dogs. We let him sniff a few and it seemed fine, we were starting to doubt everything that the kill shelter had said about him. We found a quiet spot at the chaotic festival and he sat with us, observing. People came over to meet him and he was so friendly and loving to everyone. No one believed that we had just rescued him.\\nThe next day we had received a front clipping harness and the moment we put it on him, he stopped pulling on walks. He still got distracted outside but he was so much better at walking calmly. We let him sniff more dogs and discovered that he was super friendly but couldn’t tell between dogs that wanted to play or fight.\\nThe following week he started to feel at home. We let him sit with us on the couch but still kept him out of bed. He behaved better every day. Except the one time he jumped on the bed when I screamed because I saw a spider – but that’s because I screamed and I assume that he was trying to protect me.\\nDuring the week we also let him play with some dogs while leashed. He seemed to get along with everyone, ignoring the dogs who were aggressive and he backed away when an angry cat jumped out at him. He was clearly a good gentle boy!\\nThat second weekend we had him, we took him to an amazing day care Petbuddy Services for a trial day. We were nervous to see how he would get a long with other dogs but it went really well! After a day of playing with dogs, he was even calmer on walks and less jumpy when he met new dogs.\\nThe day he spent at doggy daycare we went out, but came home before picking Smiley up. Our home felt so empty without him even though he had only been there for ten days! That’s when we decided that we’d be keeping him. But we wanted to wait in case there were any issues with our landlord, although those were unlikely.\\nOn Wednesday we took him to the vet again, and even though the rescue knew we were 99% likely to adopt him, Pound Hounds Res-Q paid his bill. Later that evening, we officially paid his adoption fee and he became a part of our family. The next day, I let him play off leash with a bunch of friendly dogs at the park and he did so well, people didn’t believe me that he was a new rescue.\\nSince getting Smiley there has been more stress in my life – we need to figure out where he will be while we’re on holiday. We need to worry about him getting sick, hurting himself or feeling lonely when he’s alone at home. I also have a companion at home now, a smiling face that makes me happier and I can’t walk him down the street without him getting compliments left and right. Oh, he also gets me out of the house more and breathing that fresh New York air! I’ve even met a few local dog owners that are quickly becoming friends.\\nOf course I’m already worrying about Smiley dying one day, but that’s just how my brain works. He has already made my life so much better and more worthwhile. As much as I think that everyone should adopt a dog, or five, immediately, I understand that not everyone is int he position to do so.\\nFoster! If you can’t adopt. Donate to rescues, if you want to help but can’t foster. Dogs, and animals in general, bring so much happiness and unconditional love to our hectic lives. They deserve our help and love, they should all feel safe and happy – the same way they make us feel. Please consider donating to Pound Hounds Res-Q today, without them we wouldn’t have this beautiful dog as a part of our family!\\nWe’ve been to Tonsai twice now – once in December and the second time in July. December was hot, dry, lively and exciting! In July it was dead, everything was closed, the weather was miserable! Tonsai is a great place that’s still pretty empty compared to Phi Phi Island and even neighboring beaches.\\nWhile it’s the perfect getaway during high (and dry) season, it’s really not enjoyable during the low (monsoon) season. Unless you enjoy being one of 10 tourists on a hard to get to spot with only two available restaurants that mainly serve fried food. If you come any other time, you can enjoy a long tail boat ride to the beach, a choice of many restaurants, food vendors and bars, there are lots of people hanging out on the beach or at the hostels but there are also thieving mischievous monkeys!\\nWe’re Fostering a Dog Saved from the Kill Shelter!\\nSmiley was pulled from the NYACC by Pound Hounds Res-Q. We are considering adopting him ourselves because he’s such a good boy. The Dodo wrote about him a week ago with the hopes that his story will inspire others to adopt, foster and rescue dogs in need!\\nAuthor olenakaguiPosted on October 23, 2018 October 22, 2018 Categories Animals and Pets, New YorkTags dog saved, foster, fostering, kill shelter, Pound Hounds, Pound Hounds Resq, rescue, rescue dog, SmileyLeave a comment on We’re Fostering a Dog Saved from the Kill Shelter!\\nThe second time we visited Thailand was the middle of July, which is right when monsoon season is wreaking havoc on the island and keeping all those selfie-taking tourists away – but clearly not all of them.\\nThe first time we visited Thailand was during the dry winter months when it’s hot, overpopulated with tourists and low tied can ruin boat rides, kayaking and other water adventures.

You can stir fry them, cook them in the oven and my absolute favorite, is pretending they are pancakes!\\nIt’s prime mushroom picking season but it’s quickly cooling down. You might be seeing mushrooms all around you, even in city parks and on the side of highways! There’s still some time to go out and forage before winter chases us indoors for Netflix, hot chocolate and hibernation. However, most mushrooms take a lot of experience to identify which can be scary and discouraging.\\nIt is also extremely dangerous to eat anything that you’re not certain about. Although there are many YouTube videos and Facebook groups are not always a reliable way to be sure that you will be safe. Even after you read this article, go talk to experienced mushroom pickers, join a mycological society and always be overly careful.\\nIt is not legal to pick mushrooms everywhere. Ask a police officer, park ranger or at the info center where you can pick them. If you go anywhere else, you risk getting a hefty fine. In NYC it can be up to $250!\\nWild mushrooms are not like the ones you buy at the store. Some people might experience an allergy to a specific type even though they are not allergic to others. Some edible mushrooms have skins that certain people might react to with a stomach ache. Although I am lucky to be allergy free and tolerate everything I’ve tried so far, I’m aware that I might eat a perfectly good edible mushroom that might make me feel sick.\\nLet’s get down to business, there are mushrooms that are growing everywhere around New York right now and they happen to taste delicious! The giant puffball (tiny ones are good too) is really easy to identify, grows to be huge so it’s satisfying to find and it’s a great way to begin your mushroom picking lifestyle.\\nPuffballs come in round shapes and in various sizes. They don’t have any gills, or stems, they grow right out of the ground. The regular kind is small, round, white/grayish/yellowish with tiny bumps and they get dark and dry when they are ready to release their spores. When they are dry, you can stomp on them and they will puff out dark-colored spores, which is why they are called puffballs.\\nGiant puffballs don’t taste any better than small ones, arguably they taste worse. But one big puffball can feed a family of three for a day. They can grow to be larger than your head! In their prime they are pure white on the outside and inside.\\nIf they are any there color, or have any markings, be cautious.\\nUnlike the hen-of-the-woods that I wrote about earlier this week, giant puffballs do have a very poisonous lookalike, but it’s extremely easy to differentiate them! Once you pick a puffball, cut it down the middle from top to bottom, an edible puffball will have firm purely white firm flesh without any markings. It should look like sliced mozzarella!\\nIf the mushroom is off-white, it’s an edible kind that’s past it’s prime. Don’t eat it! There are several stages of a puffball going bad. First, the inside will get yellower but will remain firm. Then it’ll get wetter and darker, at this point the outside might be getting yellower too. Finally, it dries up and releases dark gray/black spores.\\nEven when a puffball is yellow, it’s technically not poisonous. The only type of puffball that is poisonous, is one with black lines that look like intricate designs. These will be on the outside and on the inside. These puffballs are very poisonous and should NOT be consumed.\\nPuffballs of all sizes grow in the forest, alongside roads, in the middle of a green grassy lawn, they can really grow anywhere! Just make sure to cut every single mushroom in half, and throw any puffball that isn’t pure white on the inside. The rule of thumb with mushrooms is, if there is any doubts, leave it behind.\\nIf you thought that the hen-of-the-woods had many recipes, just wait until you bring home a haul of puffballs. You can stir fry them, cook them in the oven and my absolute favorite, is pretending they are pancakes!\\nAll you need to do is cut 3/4 inch slices, fry them in the oven or on the pan with some coconut oil and cinnamon and serve with maple syrup. If you cook them long enough you can barely taste the difference – they are soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Delicious. Here are some other recipes.\\nJust a quick reminder, some people don’t react well to the skin of puffball mushrooms (or any mushroom skins). Some mushrooms have tough skin that’s supposed to protect the mushroom from being eaten, this skin can be hard to digest and some people are more sensitive than others.\\nIt’s very similar to the skin on certain nuts, if you’ve ever pooped out an intact almond, you know what I’m talking about. Personally, I eat the skin but please be aware that you might have a reaction to it! You can always start by eating a small piece with the skin on, wait a few hours and see how you feel. It can be scary to feel sick after eating a wild mushroom and not know why.\\nDo you have any stories to share about puffballs? What’s your record find (size or amount)? What’s your favorite recipe? Share your puffball stories with us in the comments below!\\nI find these mushrooms the most rewarding to pick, because even a small one is enough as a side dish to any meal and the bigger ones can feed an entire family! Every time I’ve looked for hens, I found at least one and usually had 2-4 kilos (4-9 pounds) in just 30 minutes of searching. Of course, you can also find a single mushroom that weighs 13+ kilos (30+ pounds).\\nLet’s get down to business, there are mushrooms that are growing everywhere around New York right now and they happen to taste delicious! The hen-of-the-woods (maitake) doesn’t have any poisonous look alikes, grows to be huge so it’s satisfying to find and it’s a great way to begin your mushroom picking lifestyle.\\nThe hen-of-the-woods looks a little like the fluffy feathers of a hen, hence it’s name. Here are some photos of how they can look at different stages of growth.\\nDon’t confuse the hen-of-the-woods with the chicken-of-the-woods. Chickens can grow higher up on the tree, they are orange and they grow in layers. I have heard a lot about these mushrooms and I’m told they’re delicious, however I haven’t found any yet and I don’t know how to tell them apart from the many other orange mushrooms that grow on trees! Stick with hens at the beginning, you can’t go wrong with them and there are plenty to go around!\\nHen-of-the-woods mushrooms typically grow on oak trees, so if you see acorns on the ground you’re in the right spot. If you look at the roots of an oak, you’ll notice that they have a clumpy shape with many little lumps which is very similar to the hen mushroom. From a distance, you might confuse a hen mushroom with some dried leaves. Always go check it out, and take a look around the entire tree. They tend to grow on bigger, wider oaks and there can be a several clusters of them around a single tree!\\nHen-of-the-woods are either off-white, kind of beige/grayish or more brownish, especially around it’s rounded edges. They always grow in clumps, so from a distance you could confuse them with clustered mushrooms – remember that even though it looks like a cluster, it’s one big mushroom that spreads out and looks fluffy. If you cut it at the stem and you see many individual mushrooms, it’s not a hen. If you see any gills (pictured below) it is NOT a hen.\\nHens are smooth, fluffy looking, single-stemmed mushrooms.\\nRemember, the picture above is NOT a hen-of-the-woods. It’s an example of gills, that hens do NOT have.\\nSometimes, the hen-of-the-woods grows on trees other than oaks. If you want to be extra safe, you can stick to only eating the ones that you find on oak trees, although like I already said, there isn’t any dangerous look-a-like. Hens are very unique looking.\\nDon’t forget to bring some common sense with you to the forest. If there are too many bugs on the hen, if it looks dry or off-color, then it’s probably not good for eating. While most insects are pretty safe to eat if cooked correctly, you should stay away from unintentional entomophagy. Plus, insects can cause allergic reactions in people who are also allergic to shellfish.\\nAnother common sense move is to avoid picking mushrooms in forests where there’s a mark on the tree, or a colorful rope tied around an area. These could mark a protected area, a sick tree, some sort of pest, pollution, disease, etc. If it looks questionable, don’t go there.\\nSame goes for roadside mushrooms. Think about the pollution that they are exposed to. Would you like some car exhaust with your mushrooms? I don’t think so. Don’t pick anything that looks unclean (not including natural forest dirt) or could be polluted. Similarly to road exhaust, some places could be using pesticides or other chemicals in the area. Although most of us are already exposed to them from the food we buy in supermarkets, the less chemicals we consume, the better.\\nWhen you find a hen and bring it home, watch a video on how to clean it correctly. It has many layers, the thick white stem isn’t as yummy as the rest of it so you want to cut that off and if possible, clean it outside or in a large tub to avoid clogging your drain with forest debris. If you see any holes, cut into them and remove any insects, spiders or slugs.\\nHow do you cook a hen?\\nThere are so many ways to cook these mushrooms! Chop them into tiny pieces and stir fry, with other veggies, or if you’re not vegetarian then maybe some meat, lard or eggs to make the perfect mushroomy omelette.\\nThe nutritional value of hens varies depending on the website, but everyone agrees that they have very little fat or protein and lots of vitamin D. Some websites claim that they have very few carbs, others claim that they are 70% carbs. Almost everyone agrees that they are a healthy addition to a balanced diet!\\nI tend to use too much olive oil and caramelized onions to make a fatty, crispy, scrumptious meal but there are much healthier alternatives. You can cook them in the oven with coconut oil, you can steam them, boil them, grill them probably even air fry them. Whatever you chose to do, make sure to cook them well as they can be a bit chewy and hard on the stomach if you undercook hens, although this is true for mushrooms in general. You can find various recipes here.\\nIf you didn’t manage to find any, or didn’t want to risk picking the wrong mushroom, you can still enjoy eating wild hen-of-the-woods. Check out your local farmers markets from August until November and I guarantee that you’ll find some hens – generally for $1 per pound!\\nDo you enjoy picking mushrooms?

I mean, I’ll be the first person to admit that I’ve never been a scone person. I know they make a great on-the-go breakfast for busy days, but I always thought they would taste a little bit dry and boring. Then, I made these Gingerbread Scones for a holiday-themed brunch and I was blown away. I couldn’t have been more wrong! These delightful breakfast pastries are light, soft, and tender. Not to mention that they’re full of festive flavor, thanks to the molasses and gingerbread spices.\\nYou can also feel pretty good about eating these tasty treats. We were able to make them without adding any processed sugar, but they taste sweet and satisfying just like your favorite coffee shop treats. Even with swapping in some healthy ingredients (like Greek yogurt, skim milk, and coconut sugar) these pastries bake up with a crisp exterior and a moist, tender crumb inside. And they’re perfectly portion-sized, too. That’s always a good thing for me around the holidays when I need to control my sweet-tooth cravings.\\nLike I said, gingerbread often gets overlooked this time of year, thanks to the more-popular flavors of Pumpkin Spice Lattes and pecan pie. People still make gingerbread houses for Christmas, but I don’t think a lot of people are baking up the flavors of gingerbread – which is a shame! It’s time for us to change that by making these Gingerbread Scones for our friends and family. They’ll be hooked after the first bite, just like me.\\nOriginally, people made gingerbread as a way to preserve ginger during Medieval European times. To make the cakes sweeter and more edible, people started heavily flavoring the cakes with molasses. This dark, sticky substance gives a rich and slightly smoky flavor to the cake, along with a punch of nutrition. Blackstrap molasses is full of vitamins and minerals, too, like iron, vitamin B6, selenium, and magnesium. These days, it’s also a popular sweetener for those with diabetes because it helps stabilize blood sugar!\\nEventually, gingerbread cakes turned into cookies, muffins, pies, and more. They’re most commonly found as crackers to build gingerbread houses during the holidays, but a recent surge in gingerbread-flavored products is making the spicy cake trendy again. We’re pretty happy about that, especially after eating these Gingerbread Scones.\\nAlmost all good scones are topped with a sugary glaze. It’s usually sinfully sweet because it’s little more than powdered sugar and milk. We wanted to capture the spirit of the glaze without putting anyone into a diabetic shock. Luckily, Greek yogurt makes a perfect substitute!\\nBy the time you whip the tangy yogurt together with the maple syrup and vanilla extract, it will be completely transformed. No one will know it used to be yogurt. If you have a hard time finding plain Greek yogurt, feel free to swap-in one of the flavored varieties. Try to find neutral flavors that will go well with the Gingerbread Scone, though, like vanilla, honey, or coconut flavors.\\nIn a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, coconut sugar, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. Note: add 2 cups floor, then add a little at a time until it makes a cookie dough like consistency.\\nGrate the butter on a box grater and mix it into the flour with your hands until the mixture resembles lumpy, wet sand.\\nGently mix in the molasses, 1/2 cup of the yogurt, and milk. Once the mixture comes together, turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and gently knead it using your hands until a dough comes together.\\nForm the dough into a large circle about 1-inch deep. Cut the circle into 8 equal slices.\\nPlace the slices on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, until lightly browned on the outside. A toothpick inserted into the center of the scone should come out clean.\\nMeanwhile, make the drizzle by whisking together the remaining tablespoon of Greek yogurt, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Transfer the mixture to a pastry bag.\\nAllow the scones to cool for 10 minutes before drizzling the glaze over the scones.\\nWhether you’re looking for healthy holiday recipes or something for everyday eating, we have a recipe for you!

The union was effected at the meeting of representatives of the Metropolia of Kiev with the Pope on 23 December 1595 and was solemnly proclaimed at Brest-Litovsk on the River Bug on 16 October 1596. Pope Clement VIII, in the Apostolic Constitution Magnus Dominus et laudabilis nimis,1 announced the union to the whole Church and in the Apostolic Letter Benedictus sit Pastor2 he addressed the Bishops of the Metropolia, informing them that the union had taken place.\\nThe Union of Brest opened a new page in the history of the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine.4 Today that Church wishes to sing with joy a hymn of thanksgiving and praise to the One who, once more, has brought it back from death to life, and it wishes to set forth with renewed enthusiasm on the path marked out by the Second Vatican Council.\\nJoining the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in this thanksgiving and petition are the Greek Catholic Churches of the diaspora which date back to the Union of Brest, together with the other Eastern Catholic Churches and the entire Church.\\nAs the Bishop of Rome, I too wish to unite myself to the Catholics of the Byzantine tradition in those lands. For many years, during my pastoral ministry in Poland, I sensed a physical as well as a spiritual closeness with that Church, which was then undergoing such difficult trials. After my election to the See of Peter, I considered it a pressing duty, following the example of my Predecessors, to speak out in defence of its right to exist and freely to profess its faith, at a time when both these rights were being denied. I now have the privilege of joyfully sharing in its celebration of these days of regained freedom.\\n2. The celebrations commemorating the Union of Brest must be seen in the context of the Millennium of the Baptism of the Rus\\'. Seven years ago, in 1988, that event was celebrated with great solemnity. For the occasion I published two documents: the Apostolic Letter Euntes in mundum of 25 January 1988,5 for the whole Church, and the Message Magnum Baptismi donum, of 14 February of the same year,6 addressed to Ukrainian Catholics. It was an occasion for celebrating a moment of fundamental importance for the Christian and cultural identity of those peoples, a moment of unique significance, since at that time the Churches of the Byzantine tradition and the Church of Rome were still living in full communion.\\nAfter the division which damaged the unity between the West and the Byzantine East, frequent and intense efforts were made to restore full communion. I wish to mention two particularly significant events: the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, and above all the Council of Florence in 1439, when protocols of union with the Eastern Churches were signed. Unfortunately, various causes prevented the promise and potential of those agreements from being realized.\\nThe Bishops of the Metropolia of Kiev, in restoring communion with Rome, made explicit reference to the decisions of the Council of Florence, a Council which had numbered among its participants representatives from the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\\nIn this context, the figure of Metropolitan Isidore of Kiev stands out. As a faithful interpreter and defender of the decisions of that Council, he had to endure exile for his convictions.\\nThe Bishops who promoted the union and the members of their Church retained a lively awareness of their original close ties to their Orthodox brethren, together with a full consciousness of the Oriental identity of their Metropolia, an identity which was also to be upheld after the union. In the history of the Catholic Church, it is a highly significant fact that this just desire was respected and that the act of union did not involve passing over to the Latin tradition, as some thought would happen. Their Church saw an acknowledgment of its right to be governed by its own hierarchy with a specific discipline and to maintain its Eastern liturgical and spiritual heritage.\\n3. After the union, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church enjoyed a period in which its ecclesiastical structures flourished, with resulting benefits for religious life, the education of the clergy and the spiritual commitment of the faithful. With remarkable farsightedness, great importance was attached to education. Thanks to the valuable contribution of the Basilian Order and other Religious Congregations, there was a great growth in the study of the sacred sciences and the nation\\'s culture. In the present century, a figure of extraordinary prestige, in this regard as well as in his witness of suffering borne for Christ, was Metropolitan Andrii Sheptyckyi, whose education and fine spiritual qualities were combined with outstanding organizational gifts. He founded schools and academies, supported theological studies and the human sciences, the press and sacred art, and sought to preserve historical memories.\\nAnd yet, all this ecclesial vitality was continually marked by the tragedy of misunderstanding and opposition. An illustrious victim in this regard was the Archbishop of Polock and Vitebsk, Josaphat Kuntsevych, whose martyrdom merited the unfading crown of eternal glory. His body now lies in the Vatican Basilica, where it is continuously venerated with devotion and gratitude by Catholics from throughout the world.\\nOutstanding among the heroic witnesses to the rights not only of the faith but also of human conscience in those difficult years is the figure of Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj: his courage in enduring exile and prison for 18 years and his indomitable confidence in the resurrection of his Church make him one of the most powerful figures among the confessors of the faith in our time. Nor should his many companions in punishment be forgotten, particularly Bishops Hryhory Khomyshyn and Josaphat Kocylowskyj.\\nThese tempestuous events shook the Church in the homeland to its roots. But Divine Providence had already begun to make it possible for many of its members to find a way of escape for themselves and their people. From the beginning of the 19th century onwards, great waves of emigrants began to cross the ocean, settling above all in Canada, the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The Holy See took care to be close to them, by providing assistance and establishing pastoral structures for them in their new homes, including the establishment of their own Eparchies. At the time of trial, during the atheistic persecution in their native land, the voice of these believers could thus be raised, in full freedom, with strength and courage. In the international forum they defended the right of their persecuted brethren to religious freedom, and thus strengthened the Second Vatican Council\\'s appeal for religious freedom,8 and the efforts made in this regard by the Holy See.\\n4. The whole Catholic Community recalls with deep emotion the victims of such great suffering: the martyrs and confessors of the faith of the Church in Ukraine offer us a magnificent lesson in fidelity even at the price of life itself. And we, the favoured witnesses of their sacrifice, are aware that they helped to maintain the dignity of a world which seemed overwhelmed by atrocities. They knew the truth, and the truth set them free. Christians in Europe and throughout the world, pausing in prayer before the concentration camps and prisons, should be grateful for the light which they gave: it was the light of Christ, which they caused to shine in the darkness. For long years the darkness seemed in the eyes of the world to prevail, but it was not able to extinguish that light, which was the light of God and the light of man, wounded but not laid low.\\nThis inheritance of suffering and glory today stands at a historic crossroads: now that the chains of imprisonment have been broken, the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine has begun again to breathe in freedom and to regain fully its own active role in the Church and in history. This task, difficult yet providential, today calls for particular reflection, that it may be carried out with wisdom and farsightedness.\\n5. The celebration of the Union of Brest should be lived and interpreted in the light of the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. This is perhaps the most important aspect for understanding the significance of the anniversary.\\nIt is well known that the Second Vatican Council made a special point of studying the mystery of the Church, and that one of the most important documents which it produced was the Constitution Lumen gentium. Precisely because of this detailed study the Council takes on a particular ecumenical significance. This is confirmed by the Decree Unitatis redintegratio, which presents a very enlightened programme of activities to be carried out in the work for Christian unity. Thirty years after the conclusion of the Council, I wished to reiterate this programme with my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint, published on 25 May of this year.9 This Encyclical traces the ecumenical progress which has been made since the Second Vatican Council and, at the same time, looking to the third millennium of the Christian era, it seeks to open up new possibilities for the future.\\nPutting the celebrations of the coming year in the context of a reflection on the Church, as proposed by the Council, I am anxious above all to encourage a deeper understanding of the proper role which the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is called to play today in the ecumenical movement.\\nTo promote dialogue with the Byzantine Orthodox Churches, there was set up, after the Second Vatican Council, a special Mixed Commission which also included among its members representatives of the Eastern Catholic Churches.\\nIn various documents efforts have been made to arrive at a deeper and greater understanding between the Orthodox Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches, efforts which have not been without positive results. In my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen11 and in my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint12 I have already written of the elements of sanctification and truth13 common to Eastern and Western Christianity, and of the desirable path to follow in the search for full communion between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches, in the light of the greater ecclesiological understanding brought about by the Second Vatican Council: \"Today we know that unity can be achieved through the love of God only if the Churches want it together, in full respect for the traditions of each and for necessary autonomy. We know that this can take place only on the basis of the love of Churches which feel increasingly called to manifest the one Church of Christ, born from one Baptism and from one Eucharist, and which want to be sisters\".14 The deepening of knowledge of the doctrine on the Church, brought about by the Council and continuing since the Council, has marked out what can be called a new path on the journey to unity: the path of the dialogue of truth nourished and sustained by the dialogue of charity (cf. Eph 4: 15).\\n7. The shift from an underground existence has meant a radical change in the situation of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church: this Church has found itself facing the grave problems of rebuilding the structures of which it had been completely deprived and, more generally, it has had to commit itself to rediscovering itself fully, not only from within, but also in relation to the other Churches.\\nThanks be to God for having enabled it to celebrate this jubilee with religious freedom regained. Thanks be to God also for the growth of the dialogue of charity, whereby significant progress has been made on the road to the much desired reconciliation with the Orthodox Churches.\\nNumerous migrations and deportations have redrawn the religious geography of those lands; many years of official State atheism have profoundly affected people\\'s minds; there is still not enough clergy to respond to the immense needs of religious and moral reconstruction: these are some of the more dramatic challenges facing all of the Churches.\\nIn the face of these difficulties a common witness of charity is required, in order that the proclamation of the Gospel may not be impeded. As I said in my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen, \"today we can co-operate in proclaiming the Kingdom or we can become the upholders of new divisions\".15 May the Lord guide our feet into the way of peace.\\n8. In the new-found freedom we cannot forget the persecution and martyrdom which the Churches of that region, both Catholic and Orthodox, suffered in their own flesh. This is an important aspect for the Church of all times, as I recalled in my Apostolic Letter Tertio millennio adveniente.16 It concerns a particularly significant heritage of the Churches of Europe, which remain profoundly marked by it: this needs to be studied in the light of the Word of God.\\nRemembrance of the martyrs cannot be erased from the memory of the Church or of humanity: whether victims of the ideologies of the East or of the West, all of them are brought together in fellowship by the violence whereby hatred for the faith violated the dignity of the human person, created by God \"in his image and likeness\".\\nPope John XXIII was fond of repeating: \"What unites us is much greater than what divides us\". I am convinced that this attitude can be a great benefit to all the Churches. More than 30 years have gone by since the Pope made this statement. In this period of time there have been many indications which suggest to us that Christians have made progress in this direction. Eloquent signs of this progress have been the fraternal meetings between Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I, and those which I myself have had with the Ecumenical Patriarchs Dimitrios and, more recently, Bartholomaios, and with other venerable Patriarchs of the Churches of the East. All this, together with the many initiatives involving meetings and dialogue which are being promoted everywhere in the Church, encourages us to have hope: the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of unity, does not cease to work among Christians still separated from one another.\\nAnd yet human weakness and sin continue to resist the Spirit of unity. Sometimes one even has the impression that there are forces ready to do almost anything in order to slow down, and even put an end to, the movement towards Christian unity. But we cannot give in: daily we must find the courage and strength, which at one and the same time are the gift of the Spirit and the result of human effort, to continue on the path already undertaken.\\n10. In recalling the Union of Brest we must ask ourselves what this event means today. It was a union which concerned only a particular geographical region, but it is relevant for the entire field of ecumenism. The Eastern Catholic Churches can make a very important contribution to ecumenism. The Council\\'s Decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum reminds us that \"the Eastern Churches in communion with the Apostolic See of Rome have a special role to play in promoting the unity of all Christians, particularly Easterners, according to the principles of this sacred Synod\\'s Decree on Ecumenism: first of all by prayer, then by the example of their lives, by religious fidelity to ancient Eastern traditions, by greater mutual knowledge, by collaboration, and by a brotherly regard for objects and attitudes\".20 From this it follows that Eastern Catholics are to commit themselves to living profoundly what the Decree lays out. They are asked to make a confession of faith full of humility and gratitude to the Holy Spirit, who guides the Church towards the fulfilment promised her by the Redeemer of the world.\\n11. Prayer will therefore be the fundamental element which should mark the celebration of this jubilee. Such prayer above all involves giving thanks for all that has been accomplished, down the centuries, by commitment to the Church\\'s unity, and especially for the impulse given to the search for unity as a result of the Second Vatican Council.\\nThis prayer is one of thanksgiving to the Lord, who guides the unfolding of history, for the situation of new-found religious freedom in which this jubilee is being celebrated. It is also an appeal to the Spirit-Paraclete, that he may cause to flourish everything which promotes unity, and may give courage and strength to all those who commit themselves, according to the guidelines of the Council\\'s Decree Unitatis redintegratio, to this work blessed by God. It is a plea for the gift of brotherly love, and for the forgiveness of offences and injustices suffered in the course of history. It is a petition that the power of the living God will bring good even out of the cruel and many-faceted evil caused by acts of human malice. This prayer also expresses hope for the future of the ecumenical journey: the power of God is greater than all human weaknesses, whether old or new. If this jubilee of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, on the threshold of the third millennium, marks a step forward towards full Christian unity, this result will be first of all the work of the Holy Spirit.\\n12. The jubilee celebrations should also be a time of reflection. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church must first of all ask itself what full communion with the Apostolic See meant for it in the past, and what it will mean for it in the future. In a spirit of humble thanksgiving, the Greek Catholic Church will give glory to God, for its heroic fidelity to the Successor of Peter and, under the action of the Holy Spirit, it will understand that today this same fidelity commits it to fostering the unity of all the Churches. This fidelity cost it sufferings and martyrdom in the past: this is a sacrifice offered to God in order to implore the hoped-for union.\\n13. We cannot fail to entrust the yearning for full Christian unity to the Mother of Christ, she who is ever present in the work of the Lord and of his Church. Chapter Eight of the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium points to her as the one who goes before us on our earthly pilgrimage of faith and is tenderly present to the Church which, at the end of the second millennium, is working to re-establish among all those who believe in Christ that unity which the Lord wills for them. Because she is the Mother of the one Christ, she is the Mother of unity. Since Mary, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gave birth to the Son of God, who received from her his human body, she ardently wills the visible unity of all believers who make up the Mystical Body of Christ. The veneration of Mary, which unites East and West so intimately, will serve, I am convinced, the cause of unity.\\nThe Most Holy Virgin, already present everywhere in our midst both in so many sacred buildings and in the life of faith of so many families continuously speaks of unity, a unity for which she constantly intercedes. If today, in commemorating the Union of Brest, we recall the marvellous wealth of veneration that the Christian people of the Ukraine have offered to the Mother of God, we cannot but draw from this admiration for the history, spirituality and prayer of those peoples the consequences for unity which are so closely linked to those treasures.\\nMary, who has inspired in their trials fathers and mothers, young people, the sick and the aged; Mary, the column of fire capable of guiding so many martyrs of the faith, is certainly at work in preparing the hoped-for union of all Christians: in the light of this, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church certainly has its own role to play.\\nTo Mary the Church offers her thanks and asks her to make us share her concern for unity. With filial trust let us abandon ourselves to her, that we may be with her where God will be all in all.\\nTo you, dear Brothers and Sisters, I impart my Apostolic Blessing.\\nFrom the Vatican, on 12 November, Memorial of Saint Josaphat, in the year 1995, the eighteenth of my Pontificate.\\n1) Cf.

The faster a company is able to form shared views and rate ideas, the faster it can react and adapt to changes. As complexity increases, reaching decisions typically requires the input of various experts, which makes the decision making process slower. How to break bottle necks in decision making?\\nHow to make decisions both collectively and as efficiently as possible? According to Juho Nevalainen, forming shared views becomes more efficient by using facilitation methods, by including only relevant people in the decision making process – and by rethinking the whole decision making forum, with the help of digital tools.\\n1. Split large decision items into smaller, human-sized decision points.\\nIn general, it is easier to reach small decisions than bigger ones. Try to split large decision items into into smaller decision points that you bring to the table one by one, by choosing the suitable facilitation methods in advance. This way, lenghty meetings can be avoided and you will reach the decision sooner.\\nThe step-by-step approach gives you concrete results along the way. You will be able to react to changes faster and see the big picture more easily.\\n2. Involve only the right people.\\nReaching just the right decisions requires that the participants have a shared understanding on the matters – for example pros, cons, consequences, risks, opportunities and so on. If they do not, they will not commit themselves to the decision.\\nIt is far easier to steer a smaller group of people than a bigger one. Make sure to involve only the people needed in each phase – do not invite anybody ”just in case”, not even to virtual meetings.\\n3. Instead of shared time, find a shared channel.\\nOften, finding the suitable calendar slot for the meeting takes more time than the decision item itself. Even when the meeting is set, the agenda might need to be reset as someone cancels at the last minute.\\nDuring the digital era, collaborative decision making does not need to depend on time or place. Thanks to new tools, busy key people can participate in the decision making no matter where they are located, when it suits them the best.\\n”In our daily work, we use an online service called Roundtable that brings together the best sides of faciliation methods and social media. It requires from the decision makers only a daily engagement of 15 minutes, whenever they have the time”, Nevalainen says.\\nTime and place-independent online tools make collaborative decision making more efficient and also bring down the costs, as potential travel expenses decrease. However, according to Nevalainen, professional facilitation, management skills and promoting trust can not be replaced by any tools. When the working environment feels safe, people are willing to share their expertise collectively and are more likely to reach good decisions – no matter what the decision forum is.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-18T14:53:46Z', 'url': 'https://www.sofigate.com/news/3-smart-ways-to-accelerate-collaborative-decision-making/'}\n","{'text': 'If you want to use a hand cursor (like web browsers use when the mouse is over a link) you either have to have Windows 2000 or above, or use a resource.

It needs you, for you are the person who determines the health of your pregnancy.\\nYour registered dietitian, diabetes educator, your doctor and other members of your healthcare team can teach you about proper care for yourself and your baby so that both of you are protected from any complications that may arise. If you have all the necessary knowledge available on gestational diabetes, there can be no problem during and after your pregnancy. Once you know the effects of exercise and food on your blood glucose levels, you can avoid gestational diabetes complications.\\nTesting your blood glucose level, regular exercise and changes in the time, amount and types of food you eat are important in gestational diabetes home treatment.\\nChanging the type of food you eat, eating at regular times and the quantity consumed at each meal can ensure that your blood glucose level remain in a safe range. After your gestational diabetes diagnosis, a registered dietitian will help you to plan meals suitable for you. You may be required to keep a record of the foods you consume and your weight. Your dietitian will also show you how to carbohydrate counting so that you eat almost the same amount at each meal to reach a certain total at the end of each day.\\nModerate exercise done regularly throughout the pregnancy improves the sensitivity of your body towards insulin and this helps blood glucose level control. Most of the time, eating the right foods and exercise are sufficient for gestational diabetes treatment. There should be a minimum of two and a half hours of moderate exercise each week. To accomplish this takes only 30 minutes of exercise each day for five days or more a week. You can even do 10 minute sessions so long as you get a total of 2Â½ hours each week.\\nFor pregnant women who have been leading a sedentary life or have no regular exercise before pregnancy, they need to discuss with their doctor before any regular exercise. Suitable exercises for pregnant women are those that do not strain the lower part of the body. So, it is fine to exercise the arm muscles by using a machine known as the arm ergometer; or exercise the leg muscles by using a recumbent bike which has a chair-like seat that is suitable for women who are pregnant. There are also exercise classes especially for women who are pregnant. Walking and swimming are two low-impact exercises which are also suitable.\\nIf it is possible for you to get your blood glucose to remain in the safe range through changes in your eating and exercise, it will not be necessary for you to take any diabetes medication. However, if you need insulin, keep ready with you some sugary food like 4 glucose tablets or some hard candy so that you can use them if you get low blood glucose symptoms such as confusion, blurred vision and sweating during exercise. If you believe your blood glucose level is too low, stop the activity, test your blood glucose level, and consume the sugary foods you have.\\nDoing home blood glucose level testing is a necessary part of gestational diabetes treatment. You will need to do blood glucose checking at home at least once every day. It can be tough when you have to check your blood glucose frequently but from such testing, you will know you have no need to worry as your blood glucose level is in the safe range. Find out from your doctor how often you should check your blood glucose.\\nDaily insulin injections may be necessary if your blood glucose level cannot be managed through exercising and the way you eat.\\nDo not attempt to reduce weight during pregnancy if you were already overweight before the pregnancy. Find out from your doctor the possible weight increase during your pregnancy.\\nYou may be taught by your doctor to count the number of kicks by your baby. You are required to notify your doctor if there is less than the usual number of kicks from the baby.\\nYour blood glucose level can go lower than the safe range if you use insulin for your gestational diabetes. Although women with gestational diabetes seldom experience low blood glucose, you should know its symptoms and be prepared with sugary foods throughout the day.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-25T03:44:42Z', 'url': 'http://www.ada-diabetes-management.com/gestational-diabetes-home-treatment/'}\n","{'text': 'The Alliance de l’industrie touristique du Québec works closely with the tourism community to ensure that Quebec remains a major and competitive destination.

Over the past decade, the country has averaged 5% GDP growth each year. Sound economic fundamentals - such as declining debt and low inflation - and a workforce that is young, diverse, educated and English-speaking has made the Philippines a rising star poised to seize the opportunities of the global economy.\\nThe new administration, elected in May, has professed its commitment to the further liberalization of trade through free trade agreements. Its eagerness to join the mega-regional TPP is palpable. \"The new government is one that will keep the policy of maximizing foreign trade agreements participation,” Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said in August.\\nWhen the ASEAN Economic Community was established last year, the Philippines also joined nine other nations to form an enormous market of $2.6 trillion and 622 million people. Together, they are the third largest economy in Asia and the seventh largest in the world.\\nThe United States is the Philippines’ third largest trading partner, and gives the Philippines preferential duty-free access to U.S. markets under the Generalized System of Preferences. $16.5 billion worth of goods was exchanged between the two countries in 2015. Looking forward, we can expect the United States and the Philippines to continue its tradition of robust trade.\\nFilipino exports are driven by the manufacturing sector. A labor force that is hardworking and highly educated gives the country a competitive edge in manufacturing. If you take a look at the top 10 exports from the Philippines in 2015 - which accounted for 83.5% of exports - eight are manufactured goods.\\nFrom wood products to transport equipment, manufactured goods of all shapes and sizes come out of the Philippines. By far, the hottest manufacturing export is electronics - and that subsector is dominated by semiconductors. Electronics was easily the biggest export in all five of the largest destination markets for Filipino goods: Japan, U.S., China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. We should also mention that the Philippines is one of the top seafood exporting countries in the world, particularly tuna. Even so, the Philippines is far from producing seafood at its highest capacity given its long coastline and inland bodies of water, which means that there is plenty of untapped potential for this export in the future.\\nThe growth of imports into the Philippines since the beginning of 2016 is fueled by increases in consumer demand, capital goods, and new construction. In spite of the downturn in the global economy, consumer confidence is high in the Philippines. Consumer goods, which comprise 17.9% of imports, increased 47.2% year-over-year in May. Consumer spending in the Philippines has buoyed the economy, rising from 63% of GDP a decade ago to three-quarters today. This phenomenon is underpinned in part by remittances from 2.3 million strong Filipinos who work abroad and further propelled by the explosion of foreign tourists – many from China - spending money while traveling in the Philippines. The country’s young population will be a driving force for domestic demand in future years as well.\\nFavorable demographics will continue to help the Philippines become a destination for manufacturing. As exports grow and the spending power of Filipinos rise, imports will continue on an upward trajectory – both because of consumer demand and the need to bring in raw materials for processing. The Philippines was once called “the sick man of Asia” because of poor economic policies that kept the country from taking off. Today, it’s well on its way to resuming its coveted position as a hotspot in global trade.\\nTo meet the growing demand for international and domestic freight forwarding in the Philippines, AGWorld has opened a Manila office. We will focus on air and ocean freight (import and export), customs, and domestic trucking services. Our Manila outpost will also offer value added services that many local forwarders lack, including tracking capabilities that give our customers visibility into shipments at all times.

The rejection mag landed in my letterbox as predicted.\\nBut what I did get was a very exciting phone call from the super lovely team at the RSPCA asking if perhaps I would consider the London Marathon for them instead of Brighton. I pretended to consider it for all of about 30 seconds before declaring rather excitedly that yes, yes I would, and please don’t change your minds thank you very much please.\\nFortunately, they didn’t change their minds and I will indeed be running the London Marathon 2017 as part of the amazing #TeamAnimal.\\nI know a lot of runners who don’t like the idea of taking up a charity place, or fundraising on a ballot place, and I totally get it; the idea of raising money can be really daunting. But how often in my life do I do something that’s worthy of being sponsored for? The stat that’s banded around a lot is that only 1% of the population will ever run a marathon – so it’s something to be celebrated, respected and definitely worth people digging deep for. I mean, they’ll probably just be relieved that it’s not them who has to run a stupidly long way.\\nSo why the RSPCA? Well, it’s a charity that’s been close to my heart since I was as young as 3 – when my first cat came into my life in the shape of an RSPCA rescue tabby called Amber. He lived with us until the grand old age of 18 and I have since had two more pet cats – both adopted from the charity. No pet owner needs to be told the value of having an animal in your life, and I’m a very strong advocate of adopting animals in need rather than buying them. I was also an active member of the Junior RSPCA squad as a kid, and was about as animal obsessed as you can get.\\nMister Dinosaur. What do you mean you can tell my toddler named him?\\nWith the charity being so high on my radar and it being such a well recognised name, I was really surprised to find out that they are often overlooked when it comes to people fundraising for them at running events, which made me more determined than ever to highlight their work and raise as much money as I can.\\nAnd by ‘all animals’ they really do mean all animals – it isn’t just pets that they aim to help, it’s farm animals, wild animals, and those used in testing and research. That’s an awful lot of animals and an awful lot of money needed to keep it going. The amount of money I’m aiming to raise seems like a lot, but compared to how much money the charity needs to keep on doing the amazing work it does, it’s a drop in the ocean.\\nWith that in mind I would urge anyone who is considering running a marathon – or any running event – to consider looking at the RSPCA charity places (they currently have places available for London Marathon, Brighton Marathon and the Great North Run) or using your ballot place (you lucky devils you) to raise funds as part of Team Animal.\\nIt says Team Animal, obvs.\\nHave a glance at this page – it’ll tell you all you need to know.\\nI’ll be keeping you updated on my training, but for now here are some more cute pictures of my cats.\\nNext Post A weekend to remember.\\nThats amazing.hope you enjoy it.any marathon is a big achievement for anyone.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-18T18:41:35Z', 'url': 'https://teacupsandtrainers.com/2016/10/30/london-marathon-2017-why-im-running-for-the-rspca/'}\n","{'text': \"So, apparently the info I found about how tables start was wrong.

They enjoy tending and watering the vegetables, and getting them to germinate,” says Silje Wolff, a plant physiologist at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Space (CIRiS), which is part of NTNU Social Research.\\nWolff has just completed an experiment that involved growing lettuce for space. The lettuce was planted in artificial soil made from lava rock. The goal is for the plants to grow directly in water that is supplemented with plant nutrients.\\n“The dream of every astronaut is to be able to eat fresh food – like strawberries, cherry tomatoes or anything that’s really flavorful. Someday that will certainly be possible. We envision a greenhouse with several varieties of vegetables,” says Wolff.\\nThe longest stays at the International Space Station have been six months. People travelling to Mars will need to be prepared to stay in space for at least a year.\\nThe European Space Agency plans to build a lunar base in 2030 as a stopover on the way to Mars. NASA plans to fly directly to the planet with a target landing date of 2030.\\n“The way space travel works today, it’s almost impossible to take along all the resources you need. That’s why we have to develop a biological system so astronauts can produce their own food, and recycle all of the resources,” says Wolff.\\nToday’s astronauts eat only freeze-dried and vacuum-packed foods.\\n“Astronauts struggle with having little appetite. They often lose weight. Addressing the psychological aspect of eating something fresh is one of our goals. Vacuum-packed food doesn’t really remind you of food. Having something fresh that triggers the appetite and the right receptors in the brain is important,” Wolff says.\\nNTNU and CIRiS are collaborating with Italian and French researchers in their quest to cultivate plant-based food for long space journeys.\\nCIRiS tests the new equipment made by NTNU’s technical workshop – very sophisticated planters that regulate all the water, nutrients, gas and air the plants need. In space, all the water and food has to be recovered. This means that plant fertilization needs to be as precise as possible.\\nWolff has conducted experiments in climate-regulated growth chambers in the Netherlands as one aspect of this research.\\nOf all the nutrients plants use, they use nitrogen the most. During her experiments, Wolff looked at different nutrient doses and how they affected the plants’ water uptake.\\n“We found that plants can, in a way, ‘smell’ the amount of nutrients available to them. When the nitrogen concentration is very low, the plant will absorb more water and thus more nitrogen until it reaches an optimal level. The plant has a mechanism that turns on when the nitrogen level is adequate. Then it adjusts both nitrogen and water absorption down,” says Wolff.\\nEverything that can be tested on Earth has now been carried out. The next step is to grow beans in space to observe the effect of no gravity on plants’ ability to transport water and absorb nutrients. Simulating the absence of gravity can’t be done on Earth.\\nThe beans are placed in a centrifuge to sprout and grow in the space station. The centrifuge is rotated to create different amounts of gravity.\\nThat will allow her to compare how the different gravitational levels affect the plants in space. On Earth, gravity causes warm air to rise while cold air sinks. In the space station, air is more stationary, causing astronauts to always have a low-grade fever. Plants are also affected.\\n“Stationary air affects a layer on the underside of the leaf where the stoma pores are located. When gravity disappears, the boundary layer in the slit-shaped apertures thickens. This reduces evaporation and causes the leaf temperature to increase. Water vapour diffusion to the environment is an important part of plant regulation and can be compared with sweating to cool the body in humans and animals,” says Wolff.\\nFood production in cities offers an opportunity to produce more food in the most sustainable way. Cities don’t have much soil for cultivation, but a lot becomes possible if you can plant directly in water in indoor closed systems where all aspects of the climate are regulated.\\n“Recycling and precise fertilization are key to achieving more sustainable food production. By growing plants directly in water with dissolved nutrients, fertilization and irrigation are much easier to control,” says Wolff.\\n“The plants become less sensitive to nutritional deficiency because the roots are in direct contact with the nutrients. They’re always able to access new nutrients through the water, and can use absolutely all the nutrients available – unlike with soil that binds the nutrients and affects their availability to the roots. And the roots don’t rot when the water is mixed with a little oxygen,” she says.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-24T20:56:47Z', 'url': 'https://scientificinquirer.com/2019/04/09/salads-in-space-are-as-good-as-gold/?shared=email&msg=fail'}\n","{'text': 'We hope you can find what you need here.

The theme of workshop was “InnoLab: Innovation for Urban Living.” SEM Vice Dean Professor Lu Ding pointed out in his opening remarks that the workshop is of great importance as the Chinese economy transitions from quantitative expansion to quality growth, people are in pursuit of higher standards of urban living.\\nWith the goal of improving urban living, 26 participants from 11 universities in 5 different countries gathered at ShanghaiTech University for the Innovation Workshop. The workshop consisted of interactive lectures and learning activities on innovation management and design thinking; company visits featuring Chinese entrepreneurship and innovation, an entrepreneurship tournament promoting innovations to improve urban living. During the 10-day workshop, participants also took part in a cultural-exchange tour in Shanghai, company visits to Dow Chemical and XNode Zhangjiang Space, teamwork at the Design Thinking workshop, and a three-day module on innovation management taught by Professor Christian Terwiesch from the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania.\\nOn July 27th, products designed by five groups of students were presented at the final competition session. The panel of judges included Mr. Jose Maneul Mateu De Ros Domenech (Managing Director of Santander Asia), Mr. Fu Jian (Entrepreneur, Founder of Zhuoyi Tech), Mr. Zhang Songhao (emeritus Senior Manager of Shanghai Municipal Investment Group Corporation), and Professor Lu Ding. ShanghaiTech Provost and Vice President Yin Jie and Dean of SEM Professor Fang Hanming attended the presentation session. Finally, the mobile app Comates, designed by Fang Xue (ShanghaiTech University), Xiao Zihan (Fudan University), Xian Shiyin (Shanghai International Studies School), Xu Lin (University of Nottingham Ningbo China) and Sofia Elena Isoldi Daris (Universidade de São Paulo) won the Winner Team Award. This app matches people with similar public transport commute routes, aiming to address safety of white collar workers on their daily commute. With Comates, they can meet up, share safe commute, and socialize with each other.\\nIn his closing remarks, Mr. Mateu expressed his amazement at the students’ innovative ideas. He reminded the audience that Santander Bank has been committed to supporting higher education through Santander Universities Program and encouraging students’ innovative practices. He expressed his hope that the students could make good use of their educational resources and innovative opportunities. Provost and Vice President Yin Jie pointed out that ShanghaiTech and SEM has made great efforts on developing students’ innovation and entrepreneurship competence and skills. He congratulated SEM on successfully holding the workshop and thanked Santander Bank for its support. He commended the students’ achievements in acquiring knowledge, improving skills, learning about different cultures, and making new friends through the workshop.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-24T05:51:53Z', 'url': 'http://sem.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sem_en/2018/0731/c3708a30600/page.htm'}\n","{'text': 'Ihr habt wunderbare Rituale.

They were a couple bucks each, and they were just fun, little games you could play in-between bigger games. I'd played a few over the years, but I never really realized just how many of those games there were. Now, Cheapass is running a Kickstarter campaign for an anthology of their products.\\nIn the summer of 1996, James Ernest began his quest to bring happiness and joy to all the people of the world, by creating clever tabletop games and selling them really cheap. He named his company Cheapass Games, and we're still going today.\\nSince that first year, we have released more than 100 original games: card games, board games, dice games, free games, and more.\\nCheapass Games in Black and White is a collection of all of our black and white games, with the rules and histories of favorites like Kill Doctor Lucky, Lord of the Fries, Button Men, and many others. It also has many more obscure games, like Escape from Elba, Pennywise, Dogfight, and The Lost Pueblo of Doctor Green, and a few prototypes and unreleased games you've never heard of.\\nIf you're a fan of Cheapass Games, an aspiring game designer, or just interested in the history of the company, read on.\\nThe campaign's more than 2x funded with still 28 days to go.\", 'timestamp': '2019-04-23T22:45:56Z', 'url': 'https://www.tabletopgamingnews.com/Cheapass-Games-Retrospective-Book-Up-On-Kickstarter%20'}\n","{'text': \"St Marys Medical Center (SMDC) is the region's most established source for quality, up-to-the-minute health care that's close to home.

In 2009 she helped us update the graphics on our website, and created an internal communications guide for outbound communication consistency across the consortium. This year Beth is responsible for writing content, implementing our email campaigns and distributing press announcements; these are all critical components in managing relationships and communicating with our partner companies and sponsors.\\n“While I was CEO of the Chase Group, I hired Beth to run the numerous day-to-day functions of event and tradeshow planning. I knew she could hit the ground running because of her industry background; I got to see her firsthand while she was a client at SEMI. Very detailed-oriented and conscientious, Beth helped eBay – one of our biggest clients – save over $100,000 on a custom tradeshow kiosk. This project required custom fabrication as well as overcoming unique shipping challenges using industry knowledge and connections.\\nDuring the pre-planning for our Power Seller Awards Dinner for eBay and Paypal, Beth used her diplomatic skills to successfully negotiate with eight of the top restaurants in San Francisco. Great at follow through, she arranged multiple menus ensuring high quality while keeping costs within budget and delivering everything on time.\\n“I’ve known Beth for 10 years when we did work at IDEMA and for eBay at The Chase Group. She’s amazing with details, deadlines and event management. She makes sure that nothing falls through the cracks and there are no surprises onsite.\\nMost recently, we managed a chapter event for the International Association of Exhibitions and Events. Taking initiative for all the social media communication for our event, Beth wrote all the messaging including invitations, curriculum, and background information to draw the 20+ attendees.\\n“I’ve hired Beth many times over the years at SEMI because of her skill and knowledge. Our division focuses on environmental health, safety and sustainability issues, supporting 2000 corporate clients worldwide.

She’s done everything related to logistics, ensuring we have everything needed for specific seminars or programs, to pre- and post-planning.\\n“I’ve known Beth for years and she helped IDEMA with the DISKCON USA Tradeshow in 2009. Her background with tradeshow and event management is impressive. Always reliable, Beth knows exactly what needs to be done. When I was unexpectedly ill the day before our event, Beth stepped in.

Welcome to Luckstruck--sterling silver jewelry with a gothic Western feel. Laid back and badass, featuring vintage glass cabochons and my signature handmade silver roses.\\nPlease excuse the somewhat gnarly hands in the photos--those are the hands that make the jewelry. :) Most items are made to order, so please allow three to five business days before they ship.\\nThough you won\\'t receive the exact item pictured, it will be the same design.

I collect things. I have a lot of cats.\\nI graduated in 2008 from the University of Kansas with a degree in jewelry design and metalsmithing. Fun fact: It’s the oldest program of its kind west of the Mississippi. I read that in the course catalog once and I’ve repeated it dozens of times. I will probably continue to do so.\\nYou know how most people change their major at least once? I never did. Kinda surprising, especially when you consider that a) I didn\\'t take a single art class in high school and b) I picked jewelry/metalsmithing from a list on the back of a postcard KU sent me. My last semester, I took a letterpress class and made my own graduation announcements. On the back is a quote from Marilyn da Silva which reads, \"Some people are said to have been born with a silver spoon. I am convinced that I was born with the hammer, to make the silver spoon, which makes me even luckier.\" Pure, Grade A awesomeness right there, folks.\\nI\\'ve been a maker my entire life. My mom\\'s mom taught her to sew and my mom taught me. I joined 4-H when I was old enough and made clothes for the fair each year. It\\'s kind of mind-blowing that I\\'ve been sewing for over twenty years. My dad was always working on our family home, which originally belonged to his grandmother. From the two of them, I learned how to do it myself before DIY was even a \"thing\". :) When I was a freshman in high school, I was bound and determined to take woodworking instead of Spanish, despite the reservations of my high school counselor. I later took Spanish, but woodworking has proven to be the most helpful in my daily life, hands down.\\nIf you\\'ve got the time or interest, here\\'s a blog post featuring my wedding a couple years ago: http://emmalinebride.com/real-weddings/handmade-wedding-diy-details/ I made my dress, the bridesmaids\\' dresses, my husband\\'s clothes, our jewelry, invites... It was a crazy, crazy time in my life and called upon nearly every skill I have. Ha ha.\\nMy parents have taken me to flea markets since I was little, so I\\'ve had a lifelong appreciation of old things. I especially take inspiration from vintage western imagery as well as Victorian jewelry and symbolism. You\\'ll see a lot of \"lucky\" symbols...hence my shop name. I am obsessed with horseshoes but I don’t like horses all that much. One chewed on my ponytail at 4-H camp and I’ve never fully forgiven the species.\\nMany of my pieces showcase vintage glass cabochons. Most of them are what’s called a “reverse intaglio.” The cabochons have a design molded into the back, which is then painted. They\\'re a poor man\\'s version of Essex crystals, some of which are incredible. Google it. You won\\'t regret it.\\nI recycle whatever I can, in and out of the studio.

Most people in Memphis and Birmingham go to the Gulf when they go to the beach, but we always go to the Atlantic with my family. I figured we should take advantage of the upside of the longer drive and give them a little something to remember. It started with a long walk to the beach, carrying their boards.\\nThey patiently learned all the things you need to learn on the beach. They did safety exercises and practiced good posture. They tried a few things from just a few yards out, getting a feel for the board under their feet. Then we watched as the instructor led them out far from the shore.\\nThen there are the few seconds you have to find your balance as you try to get on your feet. I wish you could see the delight on Kate’s face when she realized she was really surfing.\\nTrying new things is not easy. Watching Kate and Lexi learn to surf was thrilling and frightening and humbling all at once.\\nThe whole experience made me start thinking about this latest round of job hunting. It’s hard to put myself out there and be willing to fail. But like a child who dreams of catching a wave and popping up onto her feet, I must be prepared to fall and to let the waves beat me. Only then will I know the true delight of doing what I only hoped I could. Thankful for these two, parenting them is a constant education.\\nHappy Birthday to Lexi who is SEVEN today!

Every single job application is an opportunity to feel like fourth grade kickball — never picked first.\\nI woke up this morning, ate a bowl of cereal, drank some coffee and culled through emails. Then I started through my list of job seeking websites. All of the sudden, I had a feeling deep in my bones. If I don’t try, I am already rejected. I’m on a roller coaster that only goes up. Instead of feeling like I was opening myself up for rejection, I felt like I was opening myself up to new opportunities.\\nIt has been refreshing and lovely.
